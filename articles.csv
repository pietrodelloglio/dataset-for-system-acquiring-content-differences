The six wheels of the 2,260-pound Perseverance rover landed in Jezero Crater, a former lake bed once fed by flowing water that scientists say would have been a welcoming home for microbes in Mars' warmer, wetter past. If they're right, the remains of those long-dead microbes should now reside in the sediments there.

Ecstatic team members in Mission Control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Ca'ada Flintridge could not hug or high-five one another, as they normally would in non-pandemic times. But even their doubled-up masks ' whose top layer was adorned with a stylized image of the rover ' couldn't hide the smiles on their faces as they clapped and cheered, a few feet apart.

Some bumped fists with those around them while others shook them triumphantly in the air after mission officials confirmed the rover's landing at 12:55 p.m.

'NASA works,' said Rob Manning, JPL's chief engineer and a veteran of many Mars missions. 'When we put our arms together and our hands together and our brains together, we can succeed. This is what NASA does. This is what we can do as a country on all of the problems we have. We need to work together to do these kinds of things and make success happen.'

Acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk said he got a call from President Biden about an hour after landing to send his regards to 'Percy' and his compliments to the team.

Within moments of reaching its new home, Perseverance transmitted two images of the surrounding Martian terrain.

'You can see the shadow of the vehicle and you can look out into the horizon, and that is just a great thing to see,' said Matt Wallace, deputy project manager for the overall Mars 2020 mission.

Perseverance, the star of Mars 2020, survived a hair-raising arrival procedure that's often referred to as the 'seven minutes of terror.'

This final stage of the 6'-month journey involved a dramatic deceleration from a speed of more than 12,000 miles per hour at the top of the Martian atmosphere to a mere 1.7 mph when it was just above the surface.

The carefully choreographed routine required a heat shield, a supersonic parachute, retrorockets and the 'skycrane' maneuver, which involved lowering the rover from midair on a set of roughly 21-foot-long tethers.

Shortly before reaching the top of the atmosphere, the spacecraft used thrusters to bring its spin of two rotations per minute down to zero. 'From here on out it's just going to be a bullet,' Manning said.

Another pivotal moment in the landing sequence came when Perseverance successfully deployed its parachute. 'Yes! Yes!' team members could be heard exclaiming upon confirmation that the rover had successfully slowed down.

Sticking a landing in Jezero Crater was long considered unthinkable, since the site is strewn with sharp rocks and boulders, treacherous sand dunes and hazardous cliffs. But JPL engineers made this possible by equipping Perseverance with new technologies that gave the rover the autonomy to avoid hazards on its own, said Allen Chen, leader of the entry, descent and landing team.

With under-the-hood upgrades such as Range Trigger and Terrain-Relative Navigation, Perseverance was able 'to avoid all that death that's out there for us' and guide itself to a nice flat spot with a mere 1.2-degree tilt, Chen said. 'We found a parking lot and hit it.'

Jennifer Trosper, deputy project manager for Mars 2020, said the surface operations team was thrilled to have made it to the planet.

'Our job is to think of all the bad things that can happen and try to avoid those ' and when all good things happen you feel like you're dreaming,' Trosper said. 'I'm happy to feel like I'm dreaming today.'

Arriving safely at Mars was just the first hurdle of the $2.4-billion Mars 2020 mission, which will last for at least one Martian year (about 687 days on Earth).

'Now that we're on the ground, now the fun really starts,' said Lori Glaze, director of NASA's planetary science division.

The science team is already hard at work examining the rover's pictures and figuring out what to tackle first. Glaze said she's eager to see the imaging and microphone data gathered by the rover during its descent. For the first time, 'we're all going to get to experience just exactly what that was like,' she said.

Perseverance has a lot on its to-do list.

It's tasked with using its suite of sophisticated cameras and specialized instruments to search for so-called biosignatures ' materials, textures and other telltale patterns in ancient rock that could be signs of past life.

The rover's job will be to select a promising and diverse set of samples, which it will collect and stow on the surface for future spacecraft to retrieve and ferry back to scientists waiting on Earth.

Jezero Crater is an ideal spot for this work, geologists say. It features a delta ' a clear sign that running water once flowed into a body of water like a lake. That would have been an ideal environment for trapping any microbial life that may have existed billions of years ago.

Caltech geochemist Ken Farley, Mars 2020's project scientist, said the rover landed about 1' miles southeast of the delta, along the boundary between two geologic units. Perseverance came to rest on a smooth area known as the mafic floor unit, which adjoins a rough area full of sand dunes called the olivine-bearing unit.

'This is a great place to be because one of the things that scientists love to do is look to see how two different geologic units come together,' Farley said. 'It tells you a lot about the geologic history.'

Within weeks, Perseverance should be ready to deploy Ingenuity, a 4-pound, solar-powered helicopter that would be the first of its kind to fly on another world. If successful, it could pave the way for future flying planetary explorers.

The rover will also use an onboard instrument suite to synthesize oxygen using the carbon dioxide in the thin Martian atmosphere. The proof-of-concept experiment could show that it's possible on Mars to create both breathable oxygen and spacecraft fuel ' two essential resources for any humans who may one day visit the red planet.

It will be several weeks before Perseverance embarks on its science mission. Until then, its handlers will be checking the rover, downloading new flight software for surface operations, and perhaps doing a few calisthenics ' that is, stretching out to see if its robotic arm is moving as it should.

Over the coming weeks and months, Perseverance will transmit gorgeous Martian panoramas, detailed color images and new scientific findings. But there's no beating the magic of the first days on another world, JPL Director Michael Watkins said.

The spacecraft's self-guided descent and landing during a complex series of manoeuvres that NASA dubbed 'the seven minutes of terror' stands as the most elaborate and challenging feat in the annals of robotic spaceflight.

'This is a sign: NASA works, NASA works,' Rob Manning, chief engineer for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said moments after the landing. 'And we put our arms together, and our hands together, and our brains together, we can succeed. This is what NASA does, this is what we can do as a country.'

The landing represented the riskiest part of two-year, $2.7bn endeavour whose primary aim is to search for possible fossilised signs of microbes that may have flourished on Mars some three billion years ago, when the fourth planet from the sun was warmer, wetter and potentially hospitable to life.

Scientists hope to find biosignatures embedded in samples of ancient sediments that Perseverance is designed to extract from Martian rock for future analysis back on Earth ' the first such specimens ever collected by humans from another planet.

Two subsequent Mars missions are planned to retrieve the samples and return them to NASA in the next decade.

Thursday's landing came as a triumph for a pandemic-weary United States in the grips of economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 public health crisis.

'What an amazing team to work through all the adversity and challenges that go with landing a rover on Mars, plus the challenges of COVID,' said acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk.

Search for ancient life

NASA scientists have described Perseverance as the most ambitious of nearly 20 US missions to Mars dating back to the Mariner spacecraft's 1965 fly-by.

Larger and packed with more instruments than the four Mars rovers preceding it, Perseverance is set to build on previous findings that liquid water once flowed on the Martian surface and that carbon and other minerals altered by water and considered precursors to the evolution of life were present.

Perseverance's payload also includes demonstration projects that could help pave the way for eventual human exploration of Mars, including a device to convert the carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere into pure oxygen.

The box-shaped tool, the first built to extract a natural resource of direct use to humans from an extraterrestrial environment, could prove invaluable for future human life support on Mars and for producing rocket propellant to fly astronauts home.

Another experimental prototype Perseverance carried is a miniature helicopter designed to test the first powered, controlled flight of an aircraft on another planet. If successful, the 1.8-kg (four-pound) helicopter could lead to low-altitude aerial surveillance of distant worlds, officials said.

The daredevil nature of the rover's descent to the Martian surface, at a site that NASA described as both tantalising to scientists and especially hazardous for landing, was a momentous achievement in itself.

The multi-stage spacecraft carrying the rover soared into the top of Martian atmosphere at nearly 16 times the speed of sound on Earth, angled to produce aerodynamic lift while jet thrusters adjusted its trajectory.

A jarring, supersonic parachute inflation further slowed the descent, giving way to deployment of a rocket-powered 'sky crane' vehicle that flew to a safe landing spot, lowered the rover on tethers, then flew off to crash a safe distance away.

Perseverance's immediate predecessor, the rover Curiosity, landed in 2012 and remains in operation, as does the stationary lander InSight, which arrived in 2018 to study the deep interior of Mars.

Last week, separate probes launched by the United Arab Emirates and China reached Martian orbit. NASA has three Mars satellites still in orbit, along with two from the European Space Agency."

2	2	"NASA has unveiled the first pictures from its fifth Mars rover, Perseverance, after a successful landing on the red planet's Jezero crater at approximately 3:55 p.m. Thursday.

""This landing is one of those pivotal moments for NASA, the United States, and space exploration globally ' when we know we are on the cusp of discovery and sharpening our pencils, so to speak, to rewrite the textbooks,"" acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk said in a press release. ""The Mars 2020 Perseverance mission embodies our nation's spirit of persevering even in the most challenging of situations, inspiring, and advancing science and exploration.""

Perseverance, the most technologically advanced robot NASA has sent to date, traveled 293 million miles to reach Mars over the course of more than six months after launching on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Station on July 30. It will remain on Mars for nearly two years, searching for signs of ancient life and exploring the planet's surface.

The mission will help prepare the agency for future human exploration on Mars in the 2030s.

'BUILDING BLOCKS OF LIFE EXIST' ON MARS, FORMER NASA ADMINISTRATOR CONFIRMS

The $2.7 billion rover, built in NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., is about 10 feet long, 9 feet wide, seven feet tall and about 2,260 pounds, roughly 278 pounds heavier than its predecessor, Curiosity.

Perserverance is designed to drive an average of 650 feet per Martian day and features seven scientific instruments, a robotic arm that reaches about seven feet long, a rock drill. It is nuclear powered, using a plutonium generator provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.

The scientific instruments on the rover include a camera designed to take high-definition video, panoramic color and 3D images of the Martian surface and features in the atmosphere with a zoom lens to magnify distant targets, a group of sensors to measure weather and monitor dust on the planet's surface, a system that will be used to produce oxygen from the Martian carbon-dioxide atmosphere, an x-ray and camera system that can measure the chemical makeup of rocks and analyze features as small as a grain of salt, a ground-penetrating radar system to analyze geologic features under Mars' surface, a group of cameras, spectrometers, and a laser to search for organics and minerals as well as take clse up images of rock grains and surface textures, and a camera to identify the chemical composition of rocks and soils, including their atomic and molecular makeup.

In addition, the rover carries a commemorative plate to honor COVID-19 healthcare workers and has the names of 10.9 million people stenciled into three of its silicon chips with the words ""Explore as one"" written in Morse code.

Perseverance's landing involved the ""seven minutes of terror,"" a fiery atmospheric entry in a protective capsule which involved a parachute-assisted descent. The ""seven minutes of terror"" is referred to by NASA engineers as the time it takes to enter the Martian atmosphere and descend to the surface.

The spacecraft is guided solely by pre-programmed controls in its onboard computer, due to a roughly 11 minute signal delay between Earth and Mars.

Perseverance entered into the atmosphere at about 12,100 miles per hour in a protective capsule. The spacecraft then deployed a parachute to begin slowing down before removing its protective capsule and heat shield. The rover's landing mechanism then fired eight rocket thrusters to slow down from about 170 miles per hour to about two miles per hour and guide it to a proper landing spot before using a sky crane to lower onto Mars' surface.

Perseverance landed in the Jezero Crater, a 28-mile-wide basin in the northern hemisphere of Mars, where NASA believes a body of water about the size of Lake Tahoe used to flow. The Perseverance science team believes this ancient river delta and lake deposits could have collected and preserved organic molecules and other potential signs of microbial life.

Perseverance is also carrying the Ingenuity helicopter, a technology demonstration that will attempt the first powered, controlled flight on another planet.

Ingenuinity will be deployed in a few months from underneath the rover in a flat area. Perseverance will then drive about 330 feet away to capture the flight attempt with its cameras. Once Ingenuity's test flights are complete, the rover's search for evidence of ancient microbial life will begin.

Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with the European Space Agency, will send spacecraft to Mars to collect the cached samples recovered from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis."

3	3	"After zipping hundreds of millions of miles through space, the Mars rover Perseverance is just minutes away from attempting to land on the red planet in what has been described as one of the most daring robotic maneuvers in NASA's history.

The car-size rover, which launched in July 2020, is aiming to touch down on Mars on Thursday at around 3:55 p.m. ET. If successful, Perseverance will become NASA's fifth rover to land on the red planet and will kick off the agency's most ambitious mission yet to examine whether life ever existed on Mars.

'Perseverance is attempting to answer one of the biggest questions in the history of humanity: Is there life elsewhere in the solar system'' said Chris Carberry, co-founder and CEO of Explore Mars, a nonprofit organization that advocates for human exploration of the planet. 'If people can't get excited about this mission, I don't know what's wrong with them.'

Carberry said the mission could reveal tantalizing new details about Mars' history and geology. But first, Perseverance has to stick its landing. And that will be no small feat.

Like its predecessor, Curiosity, the Perseverance rover's descent to the Martian surface has been dubbed the 'seven minutes of terror.' This is because a complex sequence of programmed events must occur at precise times in order for the landing to be successful. And because of limits with deep-space communication, engineers in NASA's mission control may not be able to follow along in real time.

'Once it enters Mars' atmosphere, the entire spacecraft is pretty much acting autonomously,' said Janet Ivey, president of Explore Mars. 'You can't send a message from Earth to divert it from landing on a hill or near a big rock. It's a nail-biter for sure.'

Only around half of all previous attempts to land a spacecraft on Mars have succeeded, according to NASA, and Perseverance's planned touchdown is particularly risky.

Once the rover enters Mars' atmosphere, it will be traveling at roughly 12,000 miles per hour, according to NASA. A parachute will then be deployed and shortly before touchdown a 'jetpack' will fire a series of retrorockets to slow the spacecraft. An intricate sky-crane ' similar to the one used during the Curiosity rover's landing ' will then lower the rover to the Martian surface.

During the nerve-racking entry and descent phase, friction from Mars' atmosphere will also subject the spacecraft to temperatures of more than 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit, mission managers have said.

The rover is aiming to settle in Jezero Crater, a 28-mile-wide basin just north of the Martian equator that scientists think was once home to an ancient river delta. If Mars once supported life billions of years ago, it's thought that Jezero Crater could be the best place to look for potential fossilized clues in the region's sediments and mineral deposits.

But Jezero's landscape is also characterized by large boulder fields, sand dunes and cliffs that make a landing unpredictable and challenging.

'No Mars landing is guaranteed, but we have been preparing a decade to put this rover's wheels down on the surface of Mars and get to work,' Jennifer Trosper, deputy project manager for the Perseverance mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a statement.

If successful, the Perseverance mission could be the start of a new era of Mars exploration, according to Robert Zubrin, author of 'The Case for Mars' and founder of The Mars Society, a nonprofit organization that aims to advance human missions to the red planet.

'Perseverance could conceivably find fossilized microbial life,' Zubrin said. 'If we could drill, find these microfossils, bring them up and subject them to all kinds of examination, we would find out the truth about life in the universe. That is powerful stuff.'

The mission will also lay the groundwork for future human missions to the red planet.

The rover is outfitted with a suite of seven tools to study the planet's geology and past climate. In addition to high-powered cameras, Perseverance is equipped with a drill and robotic arm to collect samples, an instrument to examine the chemical composition of rocks and sediments, a tool to measure weather on Mars and an experiment to test if oxygen can be produced from Mars' carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere.

The rover is also carrying a helicopter, known as Ingenuity, that mission controllers will use to attempt the first controlled flights on another planet. The 4-pound drone is designed to fly around and scout out nearby areas in and around Jezero Crater.

The Perseverance mission is part of a broader NASA initiative with the European Space Agency that aims to collect samples of rocks and sediment from Mars and return them to Earth.

NASA and the European Space Agency are not the only ones with their sights set on Mars. Earlier this month, separate space probes from the United Arab Emirates and China successfully entered into orbit around Mars, making them just the fifth and sixth nations to do so."

""I'm safe on Mars"" isn't a tweet you see every day.

It's the update provided by the Twitter account for NASA's Perseverance rover (@NASAPersevere) after it successfully landed Thursday on the Red Planet. The tweet went out to a rapidly-growing audience of more than 1.2 million followers, with promises of more to come in the future.

The tweet, which gathered more than 480,000 likes as of Thursday night, punctuated a 300-million-mile voyage and coincided with the rover's 3:55 p.m. EST landing. ""Perseverance will get you anywhere,"" indeed.

""I've come nearly 300 million miles, and I'm just getting started,"" the rover's account tweeted after confirming it was safe.

Perseverance rover successfully lands on Mars: A key step in NASA's search for signs of life

Behind those tweets is a five-person team that ' like Voltron, as they like to say ' came together to create a social media persona for Perseverance. On Twitter and Facebook, the team has worked hard to show that Perseverance is a ""boss.""

The bilingual team ' the rover speaks Spanish, too ' is comprised of Stephanie L. Smith, Linda Rivera, Scott Hulme, Carolina Mart'nez and Gabrielle Moreira.

Hulme, a public outreach specialist for NASA and the person who hit send on Thursdays tweets, said there's an amazing story that the social media team behind Perseverance wants to tell the world.

""You're definitely in the hot seat, of course,"" he told USA TODAY. ""But, just like the rest of the team that's there in Mission Control, you're well-practiced. You know what you need to do. Ultimately, we're trying to just bring everybody along with us.""

He added: ""We kind of got together and thought about what makes this rover different. What makes this rover different from the others that have gone before it' What's different about its story'""

Mission to Mars: Explore the Perseverance rover in augmented reality

The character-building process wasn't about just giving a voice to Perseverance. The rover has a personality, a drive to succeed that informs its choices. Rivera, a digital and social media specialist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who on Thursday monitored Perseverance's Facebook account, said the character-creation processes included deep thoughts about things like the rover's hobbies.

According to Twitter, those hobbies are photography, collecting rocks and off-roading.

""For the past few years, we've lived with the mission team,"" said Mart'nez, manager for Mars public engagement. ""That personality sort of becomes self-evident and very recognizable to us as we work closely with the mission team. Being there every day, we see how different it is from the other robots.""

And the team behind Perseverance's social media presence isn't shy about comparisons to past projects.

""If Perseverance is anything, she's a boss,"" said Smith, the JPL's digital and social media lead. ""She's the biggest, most ambitious rover we've ever sent to the surface of another planet. She's got a rock vaporizing laser on her head, just like Curiosity did.

""But unlike Curiosity, who while charming, isn't as capable as Perseverance ' Curiosity can't walk and chew gum. Curiosity can't drive and think about driving at the same time. Perseverance can. Perseverance has a second brain and if Perseverance had gone to college, she would have been summa. But she's also super-lovable.""

The Twitter account has been providing updates on Perseverance since March 2020. It got started by letting the world know its name.

""Call me Perseverance,"" the account's first tweet reads.

#SpaceIsForEveryone: How the landing crew of NASA's Mars rover Perseverance exemplified for viewers that #spaceisforeveryone

It adds: ""I'm headed for Mars: driven to search for signs of ancient life, test new tech to help future human explorers, and collect the first rock samples for future return to Earth.""

Twitter's official account responded: ""Please find water.""

A few brands have gotten in on the Twitter fun, including Krispy Kreme (apparently looking to set up shop in space) and Buffalo Wild Wings (hoping for signs of past chicken wings).

Perseverance, nicknamed ""Percy"" by mission managers, launched in July 2020 and landed in the Jezero Crater on Mars on Thursday. The nuclear-powered, 2,260-pound rover's mission is to ""seek signs of ancient life and collect samples of rock and regolith (broken rock and soil) for possible return to Earth,"" according to NASA.

One of the account's first updates from Mars was a look at its ""forever home."" Perseverance will ""spend at least one Mars year (two Earth years) exploring the landing site region,"" according to NASA.

""The thing I'm most proud of is being really authentic,"" Mart'nez said. ""Communicating really complex science in ways that people can connect with and having that voice and that personality that people can grab onto. I think that's really important, to bring the science to a level that's understandable.""

'Hi friends,' he wrote on a variety of social media platforms, 'I want to share with you that I am trans, my pronouns are he/they and my name is Elliot.'

I've been endlessly inspired by so many in trans community. Thank you for your courage

He continued: 'I feel lucky to be writing this. To be here. To have arrived at this place in my life. I feel overwhelming gratitude for the incredible people who have supported me along this journey. I can't begin to express how remarkable it feels to finally love who I am enough to pursue my authentic self. I've been endlessly inspired by so many in the trans community. Thank you for your courage, your generosity and ceaselessly working to make this world a more inclusive and compassionate place. I will offer whatever support I can and continue to strive for a more loving and equal society.

The actor also spoke of his fear in coming out and highlighted the difficulties faced by less privileged people who have done the same. 'I also ask for patience. My joy is real, but it is also fragile. The truth is, despite feeling profoundly happy right now and knowing how much privilege I carry, I am also scared. I'm scared of the invasiveness, the hate, the 'jokes' and of violence. To be clear, I am not trying to dampen a moment that is joyous and one that I celebrate, but I want to address the full picture.

Acclaim ' Page with Michael Cera in Juno.

'The statistics are staggering. The discrimination towards trans people is rife, insidious and cruel, resulting in horrific consequences. In 2020 alone it has been reported that at least 40 transgender people have been murdered, the majority of which were Black and Latinx trans women.'

The actor continued with a robust condemnation of what he perceived as cultural and institutional prejudice against trans people, saying those in positions of power or influence who use their platforms to 'spew hostility' have 'blood on your hands'.

'To the political leaders who work to criminalize trans healthcare and deny our right to exist and to all of those with a massive platform who continue to spew hostility towards the trans community: you have blood on your hands. You unleash a fury of vile and demeaning rage that lands on the shoulders of the trans community, a community in which 40% of trans adults report attempting suicide. Enough is enough. You aren't being 'cancelled,' you are hurting people. I am one of those people and we won't be silent in the face of your attacks.'

Page concluded: 'I love that I am trans. And I love that I am queer. And the more I hold myself close and fully embrace who I am, the more I dream, the more my heart grows and the more I thrive. To all the trans people who deal with harassment, self-loathing, abuse, and the threat of violence every day: I see you, I love you, and I will do everything I can to change this world for the better.'

Page, now 33, had his breakthrough in 2005 thriller Hard Candy before finding international acclaim in Juno, the hit comedy about a teenage girl who decides to proceed with her unwanted pregnancy and find adoptive parents for her unborn child.

Page won an Oscar nomination for his performance in the Diablo Cody-scripted film, directed by Jason Reitman.

Other key films include Christopher Nolan's Inception, Drew Barrymore's Whip It and a recurring role as Kitty Pryde in the X-Men series. More recently, Page played Vanya Hargreeves in Netflix series The Umbrella Academy.

On Tuesday, Netflix confirmed that the character would not change gender in future episodes, and that they were in the process of updating the credits and metadata of Page's back catalogue of films which screen on the streaming service.

Page came out as gay in a speech on Valentine's Day 2014 and two years later alleged that the film-maker Brett Ratner had outed him against his will aged 18 on the set of X-Men: The Last Stand ' an allegation corroborated by the actor Anna Paquin, who was present at the time.

Page has been a vocal advocate for LGBT rights over the past decade and in January 2018 married the dancer and choreographer Emma Portner.

Nick Adams, GLAAD's Director of Transgender Media, said 'Elliot Page has given us fantastic characters on-screen, and has been an outspoken advocate for all LGBTQ people. He will now be an inspiration to countless trans and non-binary people. All transgender people deserve the chance to be ourselves and to be accepted for who we are. We celebrate the remarkable Elliot Page today.'

Page, also known for his Oscar-nominated lead role in 'Juno,' explained why he felt both 'lucky' and 'scared' to open up about his identity amid widespread discrimination and violence against the transgender community.

'I feel overwhelming gratitude for the incredible people who have supported me along this journey,' he wrote. 'I can't begin to express how remarkable it feels to finally love who I am enough to pursue my authentic self. I've been endlessly inspired by so many in the trans community.

'Thank you for your courage, your generosity and ceaselessly working to make this world a more inclusive and compassionate place. I will offer whatever support I can and continue to strive for a more loving and equal society.'

Later in his post, Page cited 'staggering' statistics of violence against transgender people, more than one in four of whom 'has faced a bias-driven assault, and rates are higher for trans women and trans people of color,' according to the National Center for Transgender Equality.

'My joy is real, but it is also fragile,' he continued. 'The truth is, despite feeling profoundly happy right now and knowing how much privilege I carry, I am also scared. I'm scared of the invasiveness, the hate, the 'jokes' and of violence.'

Upon his announcement, Page has received an outpouring of support from LGBTQ advocacy groups, including the TGI Justice Project, Lambda Legal and GLAAD, which praised the performer's work, behind and in front of the camera.

""@TheElliotPage has given us fantastic characters on-screen, and has been an outspoken advocate for all LGBTQ people,' GLAAD posted on Twitter. 'Elliot will now be an inspiration to countless trans and non-binary people. We celebrate him. All trans people deserve to be accepted.'

Also celebrating the news are several of Page's entertainment peers, including comedian Kumail Nanjiani, singer Miley Cyrus, actress Ruby Rose, playwright Jeremy O.

'I've been a fan of Elliot's for a very long time and am excited to see him continue his fantastic work in the years to come,' Nanjiani wrote.

'Your heart has always been big and you've used your platform to show up for the entire community for years,' tweeted transgender-rights activist and writer Raquel Willis. 'Thanks for the gift of your truth!'

Page's wife, Canadian dancer Emma Portner, rallied behind her partner as well, writing on Instagram, 'I am so proud of @elliotpage. Trans, queer and non-binary people are a gift to this world. I also ask for patience & privacy but that you join me in the fervent support of trans life every single day. Elliot's existence is a gift in and of itself. Shine on sweet E. Love you so much.'

I also ask for patience. My joy is real, but it is also fragile. The truth is, despite feeling profoundly happy right now and knowing how much privilege I carry, I am also scared. I'm scared of the invasiveness, the hate, the 'jokes' and of violence. To be clear, I am not trying to dampen a moment that is joyous and one that I celebrate, but I want to address the full picture. The statistics are staggering. The discrimination towards trans people is rife, insidious and cruel, resulting in horrific consequences. In 2020 alone it has been reported that at least 40 transgender people have been murdered, the majority of which were Black and Latinx trans women. To the political leaders who work to criminalize trans health care and deny our right to exist and to all of those with a massive platform who continue to spew hostility towards the trans community: you have blood on your hands. You unleash a fury of vile and demeaning rage that lands on the shoulders of the trans community, a community in which 40% of trans adults report attempting suicide. I am one of those people and we won't be silent in the face of your attacks.

I love that I am trans. And I love that I am queer. And the more I hold myself close and fully embrace who I am, the more I dream, the more my heart grows and the more I thrive.

8	8	"Elliot Page, star of 'Juno,' comes out as transgender

David Oliver | USA TODAY

Show Caption Hide Caption Americans wrongly think LGBTQ people are protected from discrimination Most Americans think LGBTQ people are protected from discrimination. In reality, many federal protections aren't available to the LGBTQ community. USA TODAY

Elliot Page, Academy Award-nominated star of ""Juno,"" has come out as transgender.

""Hi friends, I want to share with you that I am trans, my pronouns are he/they and my name is Elliot,"" he wrote on Twitter and Instagram Tuesday. ""I feel lucky to be writing this. To be here. To have arrived at this place in my life.""

Page announced in early 2018 that he married New York dance teacher Emma Portner. The star came out as gay in 2014 (though in this latest social post said he was ""queer""), and claimed producer/director Brett Ratner outed him as such.

Page continued in his social media post: ""I feel overwhelming gratitude for the incredible people who have supported me along this journey. I can't begin to express how remarkable it feels to finally love who I am enough to pursue my authentic self. I've been endlessly inspired by so many in the trans community.""

Page asked for patience as he navigates this new path. ""My joy is real, but it is also fragile. The truth is, despite feeling profoundly happy right now and knowing how much privilege I (carry), I am also scared. I'm scared of the invasiveness, the hate, the 'jokes' and of violence. To be clear, I am not trying to dampen a moment that is joyous and one that I celebrate, but I want to address the full picture. The statistics are staggering. The discrimination towards trans people is rife, insidious and cruel, resulting in horrific consequences.""

Page notes the Human Rights Campaign statistic that 40 transgender or gender non-conforming people have been fatally shot or killed by other violent means in 2020 alone. The majority of these are Black and Latinx transgender women.

And Hollywood is no stranger to violence against transgender women: Actress Laverne Cox faced a transphobic attack during a walk in the park with a friend over the weekend. She is OK.

""To the political leaders who work to criminalize trans health care and deny our right to exist and to all of those with a massive platform who continue to spew hostility towards the trans community: you have blood on your hands."" Page also noted that 40% of transgender adults report attempting suicide.

Page closed the post: ""I love that I am trans. And I love that I am queer. And the more I hold myself close and fully embrace who I am, the more I dream, the more my heart grows and the more I thrive. To all trans people who deal with harassment, self-loathing, abuse and the threat of violence every day: I see you, I love you and I will do everything I can to change this world for the better.""

LGBTQ advocates offered a groundswell of support for Page.

""Profound love and admiration for you @TheElliotPage!! Your strength, bravery and activism - not to mention all the art you contribute to this earth - is truly special,"" wrote singers Tegan and Sara. ""Thank you for being so open about your journey and for fighting so hard to make the world a better place.""

Netflix (which airs ""The Umbrella Academy"") tweeted: ""So proud of our superhero! WE LOVE YOU ELLIOT! Can't wait to see you return in season 3!""

Ross Mathews wrote: ""I've never met Elliot Page, tho I've been at events & shyly waved. I've been a huge fan ever since 'Juno' and - in real life - get nervous around people I adore. So I've just enjoyed his work - films & docs - from afar. Next time I'm not only saying hi, I'm saying 'Thank you.'""

""Elliot Page has given us fantastic characters on-screen, and has been an outspoken advocate for all LGBTQ people,' Nick Adams, GLAAD's director of transgender media, said in a statement. ""He will now be an inspiration to countless trans and non-binary people. All transgender people deserve the chance to be ourselves and to be accepted for who we are.

10	10	"Oscar-nominated actor Elliot Page announced on Tuesday that they are transgender and their pronouns are he/they. The 33-year-old known for roles in Juno (2007), Inception (2010) and the ongoing Netflix series The Umbrella Academy shared a letter on Twitter Tuesday afternoon to make the announcement, one that was both celebratory and direct.

'I feel lucky to be writing this,' they wrote. 'To be here. To have arrived at this place in my life'I can't begin to express how remarkable it feels to finally love who I am enough to pursue my authentic self.'

(According to GLAAD, a national LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, they/them pronouns are used by some people who experience a non-binary gender identity outside the categories of man and woman.)

Page celebrated living authentically while also acknowledging the fear of sharing their gender identity publicly because of those who commit violence and harassment against trans people.

'The truth is, despite feeling profoundly happy right now and knowing how much privilege I carry, I am also scared,' Page wrote. Harassment and violence against trans people, particularly against trans women of color, is documented around the world. In the U.S., at least 37 transgender and gender non-conforming people have been killed this year, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality.

Page has long been an activist for LGBTQ+ rights and did not mince words about those who have spread hate against the trans community. 'Enough is enough,' Page wrote. 'You aren't being 'cancelled,' you are hurting people. I am one of those people and we won't be silent in the face of your attacks.'

Many have taken to social media to celebrate Page's announcement, including Netflix, and several prominent trans activists and actors.

'Elliot Page has given us fantastic characters on-screen, and has been an outspoken advocate for all LGBTQ people,' said Nick Adams, GLAAD's Director of Transgender Media in a public statement. 'He will now be an inspiration to countless trans and non-binary people. All transgender people deserve the chance to be ourselves and to be accepted for who we are.

""I love that I am trans. And I love that I am queer,"" Page said in a statement on social media on Tuesday.

The 33-year-old actor said his decision to come out as trans, which also involved changing his first name, came after a long journey and with much support from the LGBTQ community.

12	12	"A Black man who yelled â€œI cannot breatheâ€ as a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down with his knee in the US state of Minnesota died late on Monday, police confirmed, drawing outrage from community members and leaders, and leading to the officersâ€™ termination.

Video of the incident shows the police officer pinning down George Floyd, believed to be in his 40s, to the pavement with his knee on the manâ€™s neck for several minutes. Floyd was identified by prominent civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who said he had been retained by the Floyd family.

Floyd can be heard saying in the video: â€œPlease, please, I cannot breathe.â€

The officer tells Floyd to â€œrelaxâ€.

Floyd responds: â€œI canâ€™t breathe. Please, the knee in my neck.â€

The officer continues to hold down Floyd with his knee for several minutes, with Floyd pleading and asking for water.

â€œMy stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Please, please. I canâ€™t breathe,â€ Floyd cries out, while moaning and trying to cough.

Floyd eventually appears motionless under the officerâ€™s knee.

Those who were watching the incident unfold can be heard begging police to move off Floyd.

â€œHeâ€™s not f****** moving,â€ an onlooker can be heard saying. â€œGet off of his f****** neck.â€

It is unclear what happened before and after the video was taken.

FBI to investigate

Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said during a news conference on Tuesday that the four officers involved in the incident were now â€œformer employeesâ€.

The cityâ€™s mayor, Jacob Frey, confirmed that the officers had been terminated, saying â€œthis is the right decision for our cityâ€.

Four responding MPD officers involved in the death of George Floyd have been terminated. This is the right call. â€” Mayor Jacob Frey (@MayorFrey) May 26, 2020

In a statement earlier on Tuesday, the Minneapolis Police Department said its officers were responding to a â€œreport of a forgery in progressâ€.

â€œAfter [the suspect] got out [of his car], he physically resisted officers,â€ the statement said. â€œOfficers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and note he appeared to be suffering medical distress.â€

He was then transported to a nearby medical centre where he died a short time later, the department said.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehensive (BCA) said it was â€œinvestigating the circumstances surrounding an incidentâ€.

It added that it was sharing information with the FBI, which â€œis conducting a separate federal civil rights investigation at the request of the Minneapolis Police Department.â€

Arradondo has said he requested the FBI involvement after receiving additional information â€œfrom a community sourceâ€. He did not elaborate.

The police officers involved in the incident were wearing body cameras, the Minneapolis police department said. The footage has not been made publicly available.

â€˜Trauma on traumaâ€™

Community members and leaders have expressed outrage over the incident, with many drawing comparisons to Eric Garner, an unarmed Black man who died in 2014 after being placed in a chokehold by New York City police and pleading: â€œI canâ€™t breathe.â€ That incident sparked nationwide protests.

â€œWe all watched the horrific death of George Floyd on video as witnesses begged the police officer to take him to the police car and get off his neck,â€ Crump, the Floydâ€™s lawyer, said in a statement on Tuesday.

â€œThis abusive, excessive and inhumane use of force cost the life of a man who was being detained by the police for questioning about a non-violent charge,â€ he added. â€œHow many â€˜while Blackâ€™ deaths will it take until the racial profiling and undervaluing of black lives by police finally ends'â€

Nekima Levy Armstrong, a local lawyer and prominent activist, wrote on Facebook that this â€œis trauma on trauma on traumaâ€.

â€œWe canâ€™t escape police violence even in a global pandemic,â€ she added.

This is what we are dealing with here. Eric Garner Part 2: Trigger warning: Graphic: https://t.co/beqIdpyGxe â€” Nekima Levy Armstrong (@nvlevy) May 26, 2020

Minneapolis Mayor Frey called the incident â€œwrong on every levelâ€.

â€œBeing black in America should not be a death sentence,â€ he said in a Facebook post.

â€œThis officer failed in the most basic, human sense,â€ he added. All I keep coming back to is this: this man should not have died â€¦ To our Black community, to the family: Iâ€™m so sorry.â€

Others said that while the firing of the officers involved was a good first step, they should also be prosecuted.

â€œThe actions of the officers involved are inexcusable and warrant swift consequences,â€ said Leslie Redmond, the president, Minneapolis chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

â€œTheir actions represent a dangerous precedent set forth by the racist, xenophobic, and prejudicial sentiment in our society against Black people. We witnessed a violation of our human rights, and we must hold all involved criminally accountable for the death of Mr Floyd,â€ she said in a statement.

Hundreds of protesters rallied in Minneapolis later on Tuesday to express outrage and demand greater action. Organisers urged participants to wear masks and adhere to social distancing guidelines due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Protesters chanted â€œI canâ€™t breatheâ€ and â€œno justice, no peaceâ€ as they moved from the intersection where Mondayâ€™s incident occured to the police precinct where the officers involved worked.

Video of the protests showed police using tear gas on demonstrators. Police said some protesters damaged police vehicles and a window of a precinct.

String of police killings

Monday nightâ€™s incident comes on the heels of several cases of Black men and women being killed by police or former law enforcement across the US.

The FBI is investigating the police shooting death of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. Taylor, a Louisville emergency medical technician, was killed by police in the early hours of March 13 as she laid in her bed. Police said they were serving a warrant as part of a drug investigation when they returned fire from the apartment. Taylorâ€™s boyfriend said he was firing in self-defence, believing his home was being broken into. No drugs were found in the apartment. One officer was injured.

The US Department of Justice is weighing possible hate crime charges in the US state of Georgia over the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed Black man, and the police handling of the case.

Arbery was killed in February as he ran through a predominantly white neighbourhood in Glynn County, Georgia. The arrests of Gregory McMichael, a retired investigator for the local prosecutorâ€™s office, and his son, both of whom are white, came more than two months after the incident and only after a video of the shooting went viral, raising questions about the handling of the case. Police have also since arrested the man who filmed the incident.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the shooting death of Yassin Mohamed, a Sudanese American man, who was killed by police on May 9 after having â€œseveral altercationsâ€ with law enforcement in the 24 hours before his death. Police say they fired on Mohamed after he charged officers with a large rock. The Council on American-Islamic Relations in Georgia has condemned the incident and called for answers, including whether Mohamed was suffering from mental health issues.

According to the Washington Post Fatal Force database, more than 1,000 people have been shot and killed by police in the last year. According to the database, Black Americans are killed by police at a disproportionate rate.

African American adults are nearly six times as likely to be imprisoned or jailed than white adults, according to the Sentencing Project watchdog group.

These racial disparities have given rise to Black Lives Matter, which was founded in 2013 and seeks to end police violence and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities."

13	13	"""They're going to kill me,"" said George Floyd, as a police officer pushed a knee into his neck.

Facebook / Via Facebook: photo George Floyd, known as Big Floyd to his friends.

Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired, according to the city's mayor, after a disturbing video showed a black man dying in police custody on Monday night as he repeatedly said ""I can't breathe"" while a white police officer pushed a knee into his neck. The man, who was not officially identified by police, was named as George Floyd by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as well as attorney Benjamin Crump, who said he was representing the family. Mayor Frey said on Tuesday afternoon that four officers involved in Floyd's death had been fired. ""This is the right call,"" he tweeted.

Forgery is NOT a crime punishable by death. This is not only #POLICEBRUTALITY, it is MURDER! First Eric Garner, now this. We must put an end to the senseless killing of our Black men! #BlackLivesMatter

In a video originally posted to Facebook by an onlooker, Floyd can be seen talking to officers and onlookers, begging for help, as two officers press him into the ground, before he becomes unresponsive.

â€œPlease, please, I canâ€™t breathe. Please, man, please,â€ Floyd says repeatedly, as a police officer holds a knee against his neck for eight minutes. ""I can't breathe,"" says Floyd. A person can be heard talking to Floyd, telling him to get up and get in the car, although it is unclear if it is an officer speaking.

""I can't move,"" says Floyd. ""Everything hurts. Give me some water or something, please. I can't breathe, officer.""

""They're going to kill me,"" Floyd says. ""They're going to kill me, man.""

Onlookers can be heard calling on police to stop, stating the man's nose was bleeding, he was not resisting arrest, and that the officer was stopping his breathing.

""He's fine,"" responds one officer, saying they'd tried to put Floyd into a car for 10 minutes. When Floyd becomes unresponsive, onlookers start demanding officers give the man medical attention. ""He's not responsive right now,"" says one onlooker, who goes forward to help as a police officer pulls out a can of mace. ""Does he have a pulse'"" asks another onlooker. ""Check his pulse!"" The officers repeatedly tell the onlookers to get back and do not immediately provide medical attention for the unresponsive man in their custody. Paramedics then arrive, check Floyd's pulse, and roll him onto a gurney and into an ambulance. Police told local station KSTP Floyd was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

Crump, who is representing Floyd's family, released a statement Tuesday demanding answers from the police department. ""We all watched the horrific death of George Floyd on video as witnesses begged the police officer to take him into the police car and get off his neck. This abusive, excessive and inhumane use of force cost the life of a man who was being detained by the police for questioning about a non-violence charge,"" he said in a statement. ""How may 'while black' deaths will it take until the racial profiling and undervaluing of black lives by police finally ends'""

The incident took place in front of a supermarket at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis. Vanita Williams told BuzzFeed News she witnessed the incident and is demanding justice for her friend, who she said had been hospitalized with COVID-19 just last month. ""He survived corona and couldnâ€™t survive going to the store,"" said Williams, 57. ""We want the police to be held accountable for the negligence,"" said Williams. ""We want them to be held accountable for not being responsible."" She said police officers used excessive force and failed to seek medical attention quickly enough.

""I think the police that were there should be fired and should come up on criminal charges,"" said Williams. ""We were just trying to get some help,"" she said, weeping. ""When he stopped moving, we knew he was gone... He died with his hands behind his back saying 'Help me, I canâ€™t breathe.' He died in handcuffs."" She knew Floyd, known as ""Big Floyd,"" because he worked as a security guard at a downtown homeless shelter. ""He gave us hugs, and told us it was going to be OK, he told us we could make it,"" said Williams. ""He was such a big brother to me."" She said Floyd had moved to Minneapolis from Texas a few years earlier, to change his life, and went out of his way to help the underprivileged, such as people experiencing homelessness, people dealing with drug addiction, and sex workers. ""He was articulate, he was grounded, he was spiritual, he was an athlete, he was an organizer, he was a comforter, he was an encourager,"" said Williams. ""I could just go on and on and on about who he was. That guy did not deserve to die like that."" In a statement, police said they had initially been called to the scene to investigate a forgery. Minneapolis police did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment, but in a statement to KSTP, police spokesperson John Elder said Floyd died after ""medical distress."" ""He was ordered to step from the car â€¦ after he got out he physically resisted officers â€¦ officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and the officers noticed the male was going into medical distress,"" Elder told KSTP.

""They are literally lying,"" wrote the woman who posted the Facebook video of the incident.

The FBI is now investigating the incident.

In an emotional press conference on Tuesday morning, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Floyd ""should not have died"" and that the officer ""failed in the most basic human sense."" ""What we saw was horrible, completely and utterly messed up,"" said Frey. ""Being black in America should not be a death sentence,"" Frey said. ""For five minutes, we watched as a white officer pressed his knee into the neck of a black man. For five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic human sense."" Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar also condemned what she described as ""another horrifying and gutwrenching instance of an African American man dying.""

My statement on the officer-involved death in Minneapolis:

Some protesters who marched in honor of Floyd Tuesday afternoon later gathered outside the police station and clashed with officers, smashing windows as gas was deployed to break up the demonstration.

In an emotional interview Tuesday night, Brown and Floyd's two brothers held up his picture and spoke of a man who ""didn't hurt anybody"" and who they described as a ""gentle giant.""

""Knowing my brother is to love my brother,"" Philonise Floyd said. ""They could have tased him; they could have maced him. Instead, they put their knee in his neck and just sat on him and then carried on.""

""They treated him worse than they treat animals,"" he said.

Four officers involved were fired Tuesday, the police department said, and state and federal authorities are investigating the case. That includes Officer Derek Chauvin, the man seen on video restraining Floyd with his knee, Chauvin's attorney Tom Kelly said.

Kelly said he wouldn't yet release a statement on Chauvin's behalf. No charges have been filed.

The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis said in a statement the officers were cooperating in the investigation and urged ""now is not the time to rush to (judgment)"" while the officers' actions are examined.

Minneapolis police said officers were responding to an alleged forgery Monday evening and were told a person later described as the suspect was sitting on a car. They found Floyd, who at that point was inside a car and police said he ""physically resisted"" after he got out. Officers handcuffed Floyd, who police said ""appeared to be suffering medical distress."" He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said.

Video captured by bystanders at the scene of the arrest shows an officer with his knee pressed against the neck of the 46-year-old, who was handcuffed on the pavement, complaining that his body hurt and he couldn't breathe. Two officers handled the man on the ground while another stood nearby with his eyes on the bystanders as traffic passed.

Surveillance video obtained from a nearby restaurant showed the first point of contact police had with the man. An officer escorts a handcuffed Floyd out of a car and Floyd sits on the sidewalk. Moments later, the officer and another escort Floyd away, still with his hands behind his back.

George's brother Rodney Floyd told CBS that he didn't believe George was resisting arrest.

""You have eyes. I have eyes. You can see what you saw,"" Rodney Floyd said in an interview that ""CBS This Morning"" aired Wednesday. ""And I saw, and the nation saw ... and every black person saw, the same thing, because it don't happen to nobody else.""

Cell phone video shows an officer with a knee on George Floyd's neck on Monday evening.

""They need to be charged with murder because what they did was murder,"" Brown told CNN. ""And almost the whole world has witnessed that because somebody was gracious enough to record it.""

George Floyd's sister Bridgett Floyd told ABC on Wednesday that she also wants the officers arrested.

The officers' firings are ""definitely not enough justice for me and my family,"" she told ""Good Morning America."" I feel those guys need to be put in jail. They murdered my brother.""

A day after Floyd's death, hundreds gathered at the same intersection where he was pinned to the ground and they later marched to a police precinct to protest.

The protesters chanted ""No justice, no peace,"" and ""I can't breathe.""

Some demonstrators wheeled a shopping cart full of rocks just outside the precinct and dumped it on the ground for people to throw, a CNN team there reported. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd after some people turned unruly, a spokesman for the police department said.

An undated photo of George Floyd, provided Wednesday to news media by Benjamin Crump, attorney for Floyd's family.

'I can't breathe'

The video of Floyd's encounter with police that has circulated on social media shows one police officer with his knee on Floyd to keep him on the ground. ""Please, I can't breathe,"" the man says, protesting for several minutes before he becomes silent. Bystanders urge the officer to release the man from his hold.

The technique is against department regulations, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Tuesday, and the officer had no reasons to employ it.

""The technique that was used is not permitted; is not a technique that our officers get trained in on,"" he said. ""And our chief has been very clear on that piece. There is no reason to apply that kind of pressure with a knee to someone's neck.""

In the video, the police officer's leg remains on Floyd for several minutes, even as the man is pleading for help. ""My stomach hurts,"" Floyd can be heard telling the officer. ""My neck hurts. Everything hurts.""

At one point the Floyd says, ""Give me some water or something. Please. Please.""

By the end of the video, he is seen motionless, with his eyes shut, lying on the pavement.

That officer never faced charges. He was fired in 2019 after being found guilty in a disciplinary trial of using a chokehold on Garner and later sued the city over his termination

Findings on the cause and manner of Floyd's death remain pending and it is being investigated by local, state and federal law enforcement, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said in a statement.

Mayor Frey offered his condolences to Floyd's family Tuesday, adding that what the video shows was ""utterly messed up.""

""For five minutes, we watched as a white officer pressed his knee to the neck of a black man,"" Frey said in a news conference.

""When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic human sense,"" he said.

""Being black in America,"" he added, should not be ""a death sentence.""

FBI is investigating

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into Floyd's death, which will focus on whether the Minneapolis Police Department officers involved ""willfully deprived (Floyd) of a right or privilege protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States,"" according to a statement from the FBI Minneapolis Division.

The FBI said it will present its findings to the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota for consideration of possible federal charges.

WASHINGTON â€“ President Donald Trump on Wednesday addressed the death of a Minneapolis black man who died after he was restrained by a white police officer, telling reporters he planned to receive a ""full report"" on the incident that he described as a ""very sad event.""

During a tour of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where the president was scheduled to watch the historic SpaceX rocket launch before it was postponed due to inclement weather, Trump was asked whether the four officers involved in the incident should be prosecuted.

""We're going to look at it and we're going to get a report tomorrow when we get back. And we're going to get a very full report,"" Trump said in his first public comments about Floyd's death. ""But a very sad day.""

Trump later tweeted that the FBI and Department of Justice were investigating the matter at his request and offered his condolences to Floyd's family.

""I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by local law enforcement,"" he added. ""My heart goes out to Georgeâ€™s family and friends. Justice will be served!""

At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd.... â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2020

George Floyd, 46, died Monday evening, shortly after video footage showed him handcuffed, gasping for air and saying ""I can't breathe,"" as a white officer knelt on his neck. The video, taken by a bystander, circulated online and prompted protests in Minneapolis Tuesday.

The Minneapolis Police Department fired four officers involved in the incident while the FBI and state law enforcement said they were investigating the death. Thousands of protesters demanding justice for Floyd gathered at the intersection where Floyd was restrained Tuesday. The protests started peacefully, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, but tensions escalated as the group reached a police precinct.

Officers dressed in riot gear fired tear gas and nonlethal bullets at crowds of protesters who were seen hurling rocks and water bottles, according to the Star-Tribune.

Police identified the officers Wednesday as Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng. Attorney Tom Kelly said he was representing Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd's neck.

Trump's comments came as Floyd's sister, Bridgett Floyd, urged the police department to take further action while Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for criminal charges to be filed.

""I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because thatâ€™s exactly what they did. They murdered my brother; he was crying for help,"" Bridgett Floyd told NBC's ""Today"" on Wednesday.

The case recalls the 2014 death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in New York City after he was placed in a chokehold by a police officer. Garner was heard in a video of the incident telling police, ""I can't breathe,"" a phrase that became a rallying cry in the Black Lives Matter movement.

What we know about the death of George Floyd: 4 Minneapolis police officers fired after 'horrifying' video hits social media

Floyd's death has garnered attention from dozens of activists, politicians and celebrities who expressed outrage over the incident.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called the incident a ""horrific killing"" and called for a ""thorough"" FBI investigation.

â€œWatching his life be taken in the same manner, echoing nearly the same words of Eric Garner more five years ago - â€˜I canâ€™t breatheâ€™ - is a tragic reminder that this was not an isolated incident but a part of ingrained systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country,â€ Biden said Wednesday.

In a pair of evening tweets, Trump seemed to try to take credit for the FBI's involvement in the case and said he has asked for its work to be expedited.

Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo told reporters Tuesday morning that he had asked the FBI to get involved in the case ""knowing that there could be a question of civil rights.""

The officer who was kneeling on Floyd's neck is white, and Floyd was black.

Trump's Democratic presidential rival, Joe Biden, tweeted Tuesday that Floyd ""deserved better"" and explicitly took aim at the officers involved in his death.

""I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved â€” they must be held responsible for their egregious actions,"" Biden said.

The former vice president also spoke about Floyd's ""horrific killing"" Wednesday, calling it a ""tragic reminder that this was not an isolated incident but a part of an ingrained systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country.""

17	17	"A massive explosion rocked Beirut on Tuesday, flattening much of the city's port, damaging buildings across the capital and sending a giant mushroom cloud into the sky. More than 70 people were killed and 3,000 injured, with bodies buried in the rubble, officials said.

Hours later, ambulances were carrying away the wounded as army helicopters helped battle fires raging at the port. A soldier at the port, who asked not to be named, told AFP: ""It's a catastrophe inside. There are corpses on the ground. Ambulances are still lifting the dead.""

It was not clear what caused the blast, which struck with the force of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake, according to Germany's geosciences center GFZ, and was heard and felt as far away as Cyprus more than 180 miles across the Mediterranean. Lebanon's interior minister said it appeared that a large cache of ammonium nitrate in the port had detonated.

The sudden devastation overwhelmed a country already struggling with both the coronavirus pandemic and an economic crisis: Beirut hospitals quickly filled beyond capacity, pleading for blood supplies and generators to keep their lights on.

Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi told a local TV station that it appeared the blast was caused by the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse at the dock ever since it was confiscated from a cargo ship in 2014. Witnesses reported seeing an orange cloud like that which appears when toxic nitrogen dioxide gas is released after an explosion involving nitrates.

Videos showed what appeared to be a fire erupting nearby just before, and local TV stations reported that a fireworks warehouse was involved. The fire appeared to spread to a nearby building, triggering the more massive explosion, sending up a mushroom cloud and generating a shock wave.

Witnesses reported seeing a strange orange-colored cloud over the site after the explosion. Orange clouds of toxic nitrogen dioxide gas often accompany an explosion involving nitrates.

An Israeli government official said Israel ""had nothing to do"" with the blast. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the media. Israeli officials usually do not comment on ""foreign reports.""

Terrorism has not been ruled out.

Michael Ottey, an editor at the Los Angeles Times, tweeted that the newspaper's Middle East correspondent, Nabih Bulos, had been injured in the explosion.

Send your prayers to Los Angeles Times Middle East Correspondent @nabihbulos, a great journalist, who was injured in the explosion in Beirut today. Reports are that at least 25 people were killed and more than 2,500 injured. Our thoughts are with them as well. #BeirutExplosion ' Michael A.W. Ottey (@mikelatimes) August 4, 2020

The White House said President Trump had been briefed on the incident. During a Tuesday night press conference, Mr. Trump said the blast ""looks like a terrible attack."" ""Our prayers go out to all the victims and their families. The United States stands ready to assist Lebanon.""

The U.S. State Department released a statement saying it was ""closely following"" the situation.

""We extend our deepest condolences to all those affected, and stand ready to offer all possible assistance,"" the statement said. ""We are working closely with local authorities to determine if any U.S. citizens were affected.""

In a shocking video posted online, a BBC reporter was conducting an interview when the blast took place. You can hear the deafening explosion and and then someone crying out.

The blast was stunning even for a city that has seen civil war, suicide bombings and bombardment by Israel. It could be heard and felt as far away as Cyprus, more than 180 miles across the Mediterranean.

""It was a real horror show. I haven't seen anything like that since the days of the (civil) war,"" said Marwan Ramadan, who was about 500 yards from the port and was knocked off his feet by the force of the explosion.

Emergency teams streamed in from across Lebanon to help, and the injured had to be taken to hospitals outside the capital. Hamad added that hospitals were barely coping and offers of aid were pouring in from Arab states and friends of Lebanon.

Some of those injured lay on the ground at the port, Associated Press staff at the scene said. A civil defense official said there were still bodies inside the port, many under debris.

Beirut's governor, Marwan Abboud, broke into tears as he toured the site, saying, ""Beirut is a devastated city.""

Initially, video taken by residents showed a fire raging at the port, sending up a giant column of smoke, illuminated by flashes of what appear to be fireworks. Local TV stations reported that a fireworks warehouse was involved.

The fire then appeared to catch at a nearby building, triggering a more massive explosion, sending up a mushroom cloud and a shock wave.

Charbel Haj, who works at the port, said it started as small explosions like firecrackers. Then, he said, he was thrown off his feet by the huge blast. His clothes were torn.

Miles from the port, building facades were shredded, balconies were knocked down and windows shattered. Streets were covered with glass and bricks and lined with wrecked cars. Motorcyclists picked their way through traffic, carrying the injured.

One woman covered in blood from the waist up walked down a trashed street while talking furiously on her phone. On another street, a woman with a bloodied face looked distraught, staggering through traffic with two friends at her side.

""This country is cursed,"" a young man passing by muttered.

The blast came at a time when Lebanon's economy is facing collapse from the financial crisis and the coronavirus restrictions. Many have lost jobs, while the worth of their savings has evaporated as the currency has plunged in value against the dollar. The result has thrown many into poverty.

It also occurred amid rising tensions between Israel and the militant Hezbollah group along Lebanon's southern border.

The explosion was reminiscent of massive blasts during Lebanon's civil war and took place only three days before a U.N.-backed tribunal was set to give its verdict in the killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in a truck bombing more than 15 years ago. That explosion, with a ton of explosives, was felt miles away, just like Tuesday's explosion.

Several of Beirut's hospitals were damaged in the blast. Roum Hospital put out a call for people to bring it spare generators to keep its electricity going as it evacuated patients because of heavy damage.

Outside the St. George University Hospital in Beirut's Achrafieh neighborhood, people with various injuries arrived in ambulances, in cars and on foot. The explosion had caused major damage inside the building and knocked out the electricity at the hospital. Dozens of injured were being treated on the spot on the street outside, on stretchers and wheelchairs.

""This is a catastrophe we have on our hands,"" said one doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to make press statements.

18	18	"A massive explosion shook Beirut on Tuesday, killing at least 70 people and injuring thousands of others while flattening much of the port, damaging buildings across the capital, and sending a giant mushroom cloud into the sky.

At a press conference later Tuesday, President Trump said U.S. military generals told him that they think the massive explosion was likely a bomb.

""I've bet with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that this was not some kind of manufacturing explosion type of an event,"" Trump said. ""They seem to think it was an attack. It was a bomb of some kind.""

The cause of the explosion remains unclear. The Lebanese Red Cross tweeted that more than 30 teams were responding to the scene of the blast via ambulances.

The health minister said at least 70 people were killed and over 3,000 were injured.

Lebanese Red Cross official Georges Kettaneh said the injured were being taken to hospitals outside the capital because facilities there were at capacity. He put the number of casualties in the hundreds but said he did not have exact figures on dead or injured.

Abbas Ibrahim, chief of Lebanese General Security, said the explosion might have been caused by highly explosive material that was confiscated from a ship some time ago and stored at the port. Local television channel LBC said the material was sodium nitrate.

The blast was stunning even for a city that has seen civil war, suicide bombings and bombardment by Israel. It could be heard and felt as far away as Cyprus, more than 180 miles across the Mediterranean.

""It was a real horror show. I haven't seen anything like that since the days of the (civil) war,"" said Marwan Ramadan, who was about 550 yards from the port and was knocked off his feet by the force of the explosion.

The fire then appeared to catch at a nearby building, triggering a more massive explosion, sending up a mushroom cloud and a shock wave.

Hours after the explosion ambulances were still carrying away the wounded. Officials said the city's hospitals were filled to capacity.

The afternoon blast shook several parts of the capital and thick smoke billowed from the city center. Residents reported windows being blown out, and balconies and ceilings collapsing. The explosion appeared to be centered around Beirut's port and caused wide-scale destruction and shattered windows miles away.

A civil defense official on the scene of the blast said his men had evacuated dozens to hospitals and that there were still bodies inside the port, many of them under debris.

Dozens of ambulances ferried the injured from the port area, where the wounded lay on the ground, Associated Press staff at the scene said. Hospitals were calling for blood donations.

'I saw a fireball and smoke billowing over Beirut. People were screaming and running, bleeding. Balconies were blown off buildings. Glass in high-rise buildings shattered and fell to the street,' one unnamed witness told Reuters.

""We are aware of the explosion and are concerned for the potential loss of life due to such a massive explosion,"" Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said in a statement to Fox News.

The cause of the blast is under investigation but Hezbollah is already in the limelight, multiple intelligence sources told Fox News.

'There are cars with dead people in the streets under rubble, and the medical infrastructure was already at full speed due to the pandemic and lack of supplies,' one source in the region said.

Another source told Fox News that the port was unofficially controlled by Hezbollah, thus pointing out that other adverse players in the region could have played a role.

An Israeli government official said Israel ""had nothing to do"" with the blast. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the media. Israeli officials usually do not comment on ""foreign reports.""

An Associated Press photographer near the port witnessed people wounded on the ground and widespread destruction in central Beirut. Some local televisions stations reported the blast originated inside an area where firecrackers were stored.

""It was like a nuclear explosion,"" said Walid Abdo, a 43-year-old school teacher in the neighborhood of Gemayzeh near Beirut.

Charbel Haj, who works at the port, said it started as small explosions like firecrackers, then the huge blast erupted, and he was thrown off his feet.

Miles from the port, balconies were knocked down, windows shattered, streets were covered with glass and bricks and lined with wrecked cars. Motorcyclists picked their way through traffic, carrying the injured.

The explosion happened just days before a United Nations tribunal is expected to issue its verdict on four alleged Hezbollah members accused of killing former Lebanon Prime Minister Rafic Hariri in a 2005 car bombing on the Beirut seafront, the BBC reported.

Some reports said there might have been a second blast Tuesday across the city near the Hariri family residence.

The blast came at a time when Lebanon's economy is facing collapse, hit both by a financial crisis and coronavirus restrictions. Many have lost jobs, while the worth of their savings has evaporated as the currency has plunged in value against the dollar. The result has thrown many into poverty.

19	19	"BEIRUT ' A ""colossal"" explosion that rocked the port area of Lebanon's capital Tuesday, killing dozens of people and injuring thousands more, happened at a warehouse where tons of ammonium nitrate were being stored, the prime minister said.

""I will not rest until we find the person responsible for what happened, to hold him accountable and impose the most severe penalties,"" Prime Minister Hassan Diab said.

Diab said it was ""unacceptable"" that a shipment of ammonium nitrate estimated at 2,750 tons had been in warehouse for six years without ""preventive measures"" to protect it. The chemical compound, which is commercially available, is used widely in fertilizers and explosives.

It wasn't clear what ignited the shipment, but at least 4,000 people were injured and 100 others were killed, the secretary-general of the Lebanese Red Cross, George Kettana, told Lebanese broadcaster LBCI on Wednesday. The number of casualties could rise ' some of the injuries are serious and some people are still trapped under rubble, Kettana said.

Images and videos on social media appear to show large plumes of smoke and damaged buildings.

The head of Lebanon's general security agency, Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, who toured the Beirut port to inspect the damage, said: ""It is not possible to pre-empt investigations and say that there was a terrorist act.""

Speaking during a coronavirus task force briefing Tuesday, President Donald Trump said the explosion looked ""like a terrible attack,"" although he offered no evidence and said later that the conclusion was based on the presumptions of U.S. generals.

""This was not a, some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event,"" Trump said.

Lebanon's National News Agency reported that wheat was being stored in a nearby warehouse. Firetrucks rushed to the scene, and evacuation operations were underway, it said. Military and security personnel were also on the scene to ease traffic to make way for emergency vehicles.

The Lebanese Red Cross confirmed on Twitter that it had more than 30 teams, including ambulances, responding to the blast and had put out an urgent call for blood donations.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun said on Twitter that the Public Health Ministry would meet the expenses of treating the wounded and that the government would provide shelter and support to displaced families whose properties were damaged.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian offered condolences and said France was ready to assist its former colony.

'Lots of destruction'

Video from the Beirut offices of the Daily Star, a Lebanese newspaper, appears to show fallen-in parts of the roof, blown-out windows and damaged furniture, indicating the strength of the blast. Hours later, the U.S. Embassy warned of toxic gases and told people to stay indoors and wear masks.

An NBC News journalist in the city felt the explosion from her apartment, more than a kilometer from the port, as her windows and doors were blown out, filling the stairwell with thick dust as residents dashed to exit the building.

Dozens of residents people, some covered in blood, scrambled to their cars to leave the area for the safety of nearby mountains.

""It's like Hiroshima,"" Beirut Mayor Jamal Itani told reporters. ""There is lots of destruction, and the wounded are lying in the streets.""

Another NBC News journalist said the blast was ""colossal"" and that it could be felt miles away as it rippled through the capital, leaving a trail of destruction behind.

In an interview, Aly Sleem, 34, who was driving in a neighborhood near the explosion, said he heard what sounded like two blasts.

""The second one was really horrible,"" he said. ""You couldn't even breathe.""

A journalist who recorded the secondary explosion, Ahmad Yassine, 30, captured what appeared to be a mushroom cloud rising from the building.

Yassine was having lunch a few kilometers away at the time, and in a video he tweeted, a loud blast followed by screams can be heard moments after the cloud dissipates.

At first, Yassine said in an interview, he didn't know whether he was still breathing.

""Later on, I saw people running, destruction, glass everywhere,"" he said.

After the sun set, parts of the city remained without power, said Joelle Bassoul, a regional content manager for Amnesty International.

""It's completely dark behind me,"" she said. ""It's completely silent.""

Bassoul, a former journalist who covered the country's civil war from 1975 to 2000, said the ""sheer scale of fear and panic"" she saw in the streets reminded of her that period.

""It's just scenes of devastation tonight,"" she said.

Officials still inspecting the site

The National News Agency reported that Diab, the prime minister, and other ministers were inspecting damage at the site.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson said it wasn't clear whether any Americans were killed or injured.

""Having witnessed the horrific explosions at the Port this evening, our heartfelt sympathies go out to the victims and their families,"" U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea said in a statement. ""We mourn each loss from this terrible tragedy alongside the Lebanese people.""

Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi told a local television channel that it was too early to speculate on the cause and that there was no reason to believe the explosion was not an accident.

Blast comes as Lebanon contends with other crises

Lebanon is in the midst of a number of social and political crises.

The country is bracing for a U.N.-backed court to deliver a verdict Friday on the death of Rafik Hariri, the prime minister who was killed by a truck bomb in 2005, sending the country's fragile political system into turmoil.

It is also grappling with the coronavirus pandemic and a spiraling economic crisis, the most severe in its modern history, that has pushed many Lebanese people to protest in the streets this year as unemployment has soared.

A Chinese spacecraft descended through the thin Martian atmosphere and landed safely on a large plain on Saturday morning, state media reported, accomplishing a feat that only two other nations had before. (In the United States, it was still Friday — 7:18 p.m. Eastern time — when the spacecraft touched down.)

The landing follows China’s launch last month of the core module of a new orbiting space station, as well as a successful mission in December that collected nearly four pounds of rocks and soil from the moon and brought it to Earth. Next month, the country plans to send three astronauts into space, inaugurating what could become a regular Chinese presence in Earth’s orbit.

Just by arriving at Mars and orbiting it in February, China’s space program confirmed its place among the top tier of agencies exploring the solar system. Now that it has executed a landing — with the deployment of a rover still to come — it has established itself as a principal contender in what some view as a new era of space competition."

21	21	"After several months orbiting Mars, a Chinese rover successfully touched down on the Martian surface Friday, making China the second nation, after the United States, to achieve a soft landing on the red planet.

The rover, named Zhurong after the Chinese god of fire, is part of China's Tianwen-1 mission, which launched in July 2020. The landing is a major milestone for China's space agency, which has advanced rapidly in just a few decades.

Few details about the Tianwen-1 mission have been made public, but the Mars probe and its accompanying rover are designed to map the Martian surface and search for signs of life on the planet.

The China National Space Administration said in a statement Friday that the Tianwen-1 spacecraft ""has functioned normally"" since it's launch last year and has collected a ""huge amount of scientific data.""

The Zhurong rover landed Friday shortly after 7 p.m. ET in a region of Mars known as Utopia Planitia. The vast, icy plain was also where NASA's now-defunct Viking 2 lander touched down in 1976.

Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, congratulated China's space agency shortly after the landing was confirmed. ""Together with the global science community, I look forward to the important contributions this mission will make to humanity's understanding of the Red Planet,"" he wrote on Twitter.

China's Tianwen-1 mission is a key part of the country's lofty ambitions for space exploration. In December 2020, a Chinese probe landed on the moon and subsequently returned to Earth with a cache of lunar samples. As a result, China became only the third country, after the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, to accomplish such a feat.

In late April, China launched into orbit the first module for a planned space station. Rocket debris from that launch later fell back to Earth, crashing into the Indian Ocean and drawing criticism from NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and others over China's handling of the incident.

This year has been one for Mars missions. In addition to China's Zhurong rover, the red planet is playing host to several other new spacecraft. NASA's Perseverance rover successfully touched down on the Martian surface on Feb. 18 and officially began collecting science data this week. Previously, the rover served as a communications base for a tiny experimental helicopter, dubbed Ingenuity, which conducted the first powered, controlled flights on another planet.

In February, the United Arab Emirates' Hope probe also entered into orbit around Mars, making the UAE only the fifth nation or entity to do so. The spacecraft is designed to circle Mars and study the red planet's atmosphere."	NBC News	China Landed on Mars	Science	15/05/2021	Target	https://nbcnews.to/33LguU4
22	22	"China's Zhurong Mars rover, mounted atop a rocket-powered lander, dropped away from its orbiting Tianwen-1 mothership Friday and descended to touchdown on the red planet, official news agencies confirmed, a superpower feat that highlights the growing prowess of the Chinese space program.

The China National Space Administration confirmed Zhurong, named after the god of fire in Chinese mythology, landed on a broad plain known as Utopia Planitia Friday at 7:18 p.m. EDT (7:18 a.m. Saturday Beijing time) after a fiery plunge through the thin martian atmosphere.

Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's director of space science at NASA Headquarters, congratulated China on the successful landing, tweeting, ""together with the global science community, I look forward to the important contributions this mission will make to humanity's understanding of the Red Planet.""

Like NASA's Perseverance rover before it, Zhurong relied on a heat shield and protective aeroshell to protect it from the extreme temperatures generated after hitting the atmosphere at nearly three miles per second. Once through the plasma heating zone, a large parachute presumably unfurled as planned, dramatically slowing the craft to sub-sonic velocities.

Finally, about seven minutes after hitting the atmosphere, the lander was programmed to fall free of its parachute, firing small rocket engines for a powered descent to the surface.

After extensive tests and checkout — China has not revealed the rover's schedule — two ramps will unfurl, allowing the six-wheel rover to roll off the lander's upper deck and down onto the surface for at least three months of robotic exploration.

""Tianwen-1 is going to orbit, land and release a rover all on the very first try,"" mission managers wrote before launch in the journal Nature Astronomy. ""No planetary missions have ever been implemented in this way. If successful, it would signify a major technical breakthrough.""

The Tianwen-1 orbiter and Zhurong lander arrived in orbit around Mars on February 10, seven months after launch from Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on Hainan Island in the South China Sea. Eight days later, NASA's $2.4 billion Perseverance rover successfully landed in Jezero crater on the edge of Utopia Planitia.

The nuclear-powered Perseverance is NASA's ninth and most technologically advanced Mars lander to successfully reach the surface, carrying a suite of sophisticated cameras, spectrometers and other instruments designed to search for signs of past microbial life.

It also carries a complex sample caching mechanism to collect rock and soil samples for eventual return to Earth and deployed a small helicopter — Ingenuity — that has carried out five successful test flights to date.

Tianwen-1 is the first all-Chinese mission to the red planet and its most sophisticated interplanetary probe to date. While not in the same league with Perseverance, the combination of a powerful orbiter and surface rover for China's first attempt at Mars is a harbinger of more ambitious missions to come.

Only two other nations — the United States and the Soviet Union — have ever landed spacecraft on Mars. NASA's record stands at nine successful landings in 10 attempts while Russia endured eight lander failures with just one partial success.

""There is certainly life on Mars! We're the life of the party!"" the Chinese space agency tweeted.

The Tianwen-1 mother ship, which will remain in orbit around the martian poles throughout its two-year mission, is equipped with seven instruments, including high- and medium-resolution cameras; a ground-penetrating radar; a mineralogy spectrometer; a magnetometer; and two charged particle detectors.

The 530-pound rover, roughly the size of NASA's Spirit and Opportunity rovers that landed on Mars in 2004, is equipped with six instruments, including a multi-spectral camera, a terrain camera, a ground-penetrating radar, magnetic field detector, meteorology sensors and others.

As with Perseverance, Chinese flight controllers will not be able to operate the Zhurong rover in realtime. Mars and Earth are currently separated by 198 million miles and radio signals, traveling at 186,000 miles per second, take nearly 18 minutes to cross the gulf.

Instead, flight controllers will uplink commands for the rover and then await the results, relayed back to Earth through the Tianwen-1 orbiter.

China has successfully sent two rovers to the moon, including one that landed on the never-before-visited far side. An attempt to send an orbiter to Mars atop a Russian rocket in 2011 ended in failure when the Zenit booster malfunctioned."

BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China on Saturday landed its Mars probe, Tianwen-1, on the red planet, ushering in a new chapter of China's deep space exploration and marking another contribution to humanity's exploration of the universe.

Mars has captured humanity's collective imagination for generations.

Ancient Chinese paid special attention to Mars. They were confused by its irregular and unpredictable movements, which were taken as an omen of natural disasters, changes of dynasties and deaths of the people.

In the popular sci-fi Star Trek series, Utopia Planitia on Mars is the Starfleet vessel construction and design site in the 24th century.

The successful landing of Tianwen-1 in Utopia Planitia is a stepping stone to answering questions and future missions.

Like the space station project and lunar exploration program, China is pursuing the deep space quest for a better shared future, in addition to proving its space capacity.

And China is not looking to compete for leadership in space.

China embarked on the journey to stay true to its original target -- unveiling the secrets of the universe and contributing to humanity's peaceful use of space.

Mars is at the forefront of international deep space exploration. It could help humanity go deeper into space and provide first-hand data for research, such as the origin and evolution of the solar system and life.

Mars is also a potential target for crewed landing missions. It can be reached using existing space capabilities, and its environment is closest to Earth in the solar system.

The independent mission endured a near seven-month journey plus the final intense moments of entry, descent and landing.

A relatively flat region in the southern part of the Utopia Planitia was chosen for the landing and scientific research value.

Earlier research showed the landing site might be the edge of an ancient ocean or lake in the early history of Mars. Chinese scientists are looking for more evidence of water-ice, and will share the data with their international counterparts.

China is a latecomer in planetary exploration. In its maiden voyage, it took a 3-in-1 approach (orbiting, landing, and roving in one mission), an innovative but complex way, hoping to push technological boundaries and test more options in deep space exploration.

Following the landing, Mars rover Zhurong is expected to be released.

The rover is named after the god of fire in ancient Chinese mythology. Zhu, meaning wish, expresses the good wishes for humankind's space exploration. Rong, meaning integration and cooperation, reflects China's vision of the peaceful use of space and building a community with a shared future for humanity.

On board Zhurong, six types of scientific payloads are designed to unlock more secrets of the red planet.

A sample-return mission is also planned.

The universe is vast and exploration will never end. It will take all humanity's time and capacity to know the whole story of Mars. China will cooperate, contribute and share, expanding knowledge about our planetary neighbor and beyond.

24	24	"An uncrewed Chinese spacecraft successfully landed on the surface of Mars on Saturday, state news agency Xinhua reported, making China the second space-faring nation after the United States to land on the Red Planet.

The Tianwen-1 spacecraft landed on a site on a vast plain known as Utopia Planitia, “leaving a Chinese footprint on Mars for the first time”, Xinhua said.

The craft left its parked orbit at about 17:00 GMT Friday (1am Beijing time Saturday).

The landing module separated from the orbiter three hours later and entered the Martian atmosphere, the official China Space News said.

It said the landing process consisted of “nine minutes of terror” as the module decelerates and then slowly descends.

A solar-powered rover, named Zhurong, will now survey the landing site before departing from its platform to conduct inspections. Named after a mythical Chinese god of fire, Zhurong has six scientific instruments including a high-resolution topography camera.

The rover will study the planet’s surface soil and atmosphere. Zhurong will also look for signs of ancient life, including any sub-surface water and ice, using ground-penetrating radar.

Tianwen-1, or “Questions to Heaven”, named after a Chinese poem written two millennia ago, is China’s first independent mission to Mars. A probe co-launched with Russia in 2011 failed to leave the Earth’s orbit.

The five-tonne spacecraft blasted off from the southern Chinese island of Hainan in July last year, launched by the powerful Long March 5 rocket.

After more than six months in transit, Tianwen-1 reached Mars in February, where it had been in orbit since.

Tianwen-1 was one of three that reached Mars in February, with US rover Perseverance successfully touching down on February 18 in a huge depression called Jezero Crater, more than 2,000km away from Utopia Planitia.

Hope – the third spacecraft that arrived at Mars in February this year – is not designed to make a landing. Launched by the United Arab Emirates, it is currently orbiting above Mars gathering data on its weather and atmosphere.

The first successful landing ever was made by NASA’s Viking 1 in July 1976 and then by Viking 2 in September that year. A Mars probe launched by the former Soviet Union landed in December 1971, but communication was lost seconds after landing.

China is pursuing an ambitious space programme. It is testing reusable spacecraft and is also planning to establish a crewed lunar research station.

In a commentary published on Saturday, Xinhua said China was “not looking to compete for leadership in space” but was committed to “unveiling the secrets of the universe and contributing to humanity’s peaceful use of space”."

25	25	"(CNN) China has successfully landed its rover on Mars, according to state media, becoming the second country in history to have a rover on the red planet.

The rover, Zhurong, named after a god of fire in Chinese mythology, landed Saturday morning at the pre-selected area in Utopia Planitia on Mars, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.

The six-wheel solar-powered Zhurong rover weighs about 240 kilograms (529 pounds) and carries six scientific instruments. It will be later deployed from the lander for a three-month mission in search of signs or evidence of ancient life on Mars' surface.

The Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter will relay its signal to the rover during its mission and then conduct a global survey of the planet for one Martian year. The probe has spent three months in orbit reconnoitering the landing area before releasing the rover to the surface.

26	26	"Italian soccer's redemption story is complete. England's painful half-century wait for a major title goes on.

And it just had to be because of a penalty shootout.

Italy won the European Championship for the second time by beating England 3-2 on penalties on Sunday. The match finished 1-1 after extra time at Wembley Stadium, which was filled mostly with English fans hoping to celebrate the team's first international trophy since the 1966 World Cup.

""It's coming to Rome. It's coming to Rome,"" Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci shouted into a TV camera amid the celebrations, mocking the famous lyric ""it's coming home"" from the England team's anthem.

For England, it was utter dejection again â€” they know the feeling so well when it comes to penalties â€” after Gianluigi Donnarumma, Italy's imposing goalkeeper, dived to his left and saved the decisive spot kick by 19-year-old Londoner Bukayo Saka, one of the youngest players in England's squad.

That was England's third straight failure from the penalty spot in the shootout, with Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho â€” players brought on late in extra time seemingly as specialist penalty-takers â€” also missing.

As Saka and Sancho cried, Donnarumma was mobbed by his teammates as they sprinted toward him from the halfway line at the end of the second penalty shootout in a European Championship final.

Then Italy's jubilant players headed to the other end of the field and ran as one, diving to the ground in front of the Italian fans who have witnessed a rebirth of their national team.

It was less than four years ago that Italy plunged to the lowest moment of its soccer history by failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in six decades. Now, they are the best team in Europe and on a national-record 34-match unbeaten run under Roberto Mancini, their suave coach who has won an international trophy in his first attempt to add to the country's other European title â€” in 1968 â€” and its four World Cups.

Mancini joined his players on the podium as Italy captain Giorgio Chiellini lifted the Henri Delaunay trophy to the backdrop of fireworks and tickertape.

""It was impossible even to just consider this at one stage,"" Mancini said, ""but the guys were just amazing. I have no words for them.""

For England, it's the latest heartache in shootouts at major tournaments, after defeats in 1990, 1996, 1998, 2004, 2006 and 2012. They ended that losing streak by beating Colombia on penalties in the round of 16 at the 2018 World Cup, but the pain has quickly returned.

""The boys couldn't have given more,"" England captain Harry Kane said. ""Penalties are the worst feeling in the world when you lose. It's been a fantastic tournament â€” we should be proud, hold our heads up high. It's going to hurt now, it's going to hurt for a while.""

England's first major final in 55 years had all started so well, too, with Luke Shaw scoring the fastest goal in a European Championship final by meeting a cross from opposite wing back Kieran Trippier with a half-volley that went in off the post in the second minute.

It was Shaw's first goal for England and it prompted a fist-pump between David Beckham and Tom Cruise in the VIP box amid an explosion of joy around Wembley, which had at least 67,000 fans inside. Maybe more, given dozens of ticketless England fans managed to barge their way past stewards and police and into the stadium in unsettling scenes before kickoff.

That was the only time Italy's famously robust defense was really opened up in the entire 120 minutes.

Indeed, after Shaw's goal, England barely saw the ball for the rest of the game.

Italy's midfielders dominated possession, as widely predicted before the match, and England simply resorted to dropping deep and getting nine or even all 10 outfield players behind the ball. It was reminiscent of the 2018 World Cup semifinals, when England also scored early against Croatia then spent most of the game chasing its opponent's midfield before losing in extra time.

Italy's equalizer was merited and Bonucci was the unlikely scorer. He put the ball in from close range after a right-wing corner was flicked on to Marco Verratti, whose stooping header was tipped onto the post by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.

England managed to hold on for extra time â€” the way three of the last six European finals went â€” and actually had the better of the final stages.

Just not the shootout, again.

After the misses of Rashford â€” he stuttered up to the ball and then hit the post â€” and Sancho, whose shot was saved by Donnarumma again down to his left, Jorginho had the chance to win it for Italy.

Incredibly, the midfielder who converted the decisive penalty in a shootout win over Spain in the semifinals also failed to score as Pickford tipped the effort off the post.

It was Donnarumma who then made the crucial saves and within minutes he had also been named player of the tournament, the first goalkeeper to be so honored.

So instead of coming home, the trophy is headed to Rome.

""We'd heard it day in, day out from Wednesday night â€” we heard it would be coming home to London,"" Bonucci said. ""I'm sorry for them, but the cup will be taking a nice flight, making its way to Rome so Italians all over the world can savor this."""

27	27	"Wembley Stadium, London (CNN) On a night fraught with tension, Italy clinched its first major title for 15 years with a penalty shootout win over England in the Euro 2020 final.

Luke Shaw's goal inside the opening two minutes gave England a lead it looked like it would hold onto all night, before a goalmouth scramble midway through the second half allowed Leonardo Bonucci to poke home an equalizer for Italy.

For the remainder of the match it felt as though extra-time and penalties were inevitable, as neither side seemed willing or brave enough to commit enough men forward to really trouble the opposing defenders.

England had suffered innumerable heartbreaks on penalties over the years and this time it was Italy's turn to inflict yet more pain on beleaguered English fans as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka all missed from the spot.

During the wild Italian celebrations, Bonucci -- who had been immense all night and rightly earned the man of the match award -- screamed ""it's coming to Rome"" into the pitch side camera to rub yet more salt into the wounds of English fans.

Italy players celebrate winning the penalty shootout against England.

England's wait to end its wretched run in major international competitions, stretching all the way back to 1966, will go for at least another year until the World Cup is hosted in Qatar.

Few would have expected Italy, which failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, to reach the final prior to the start of Euro 2020, much less win the entire competition, but Roberto Mancini's side quickly established itself as one of the contenders after three thrilling group stage performances.

Gianluigi Donnarumma, Italy's hero in the penalty shootout with two fine saves, was deservedly named the player of the tournament and the goalkeeper heads up a group of talented stars that should ensure this side remains competitive for the foreseeable future.

As for England, this defeat is likely to sting for quite some time to come for players and fans alike, but the squad at least has the consolation of knowing it has provided the country with a tournament run not seen for more than five decades.

Anticipation

Wembley Way, the famous road leading up to England's national stadium, was heaving as many as seven hours before kick off.

Many of the fans here in the early afternoon didn't even have tickets, instead choosing to just soak up the atmosphere before moving on to watch the match elsewhere.

The fridges that stocked beer in one of the grocery stores closest to Wembley Stadium were almost completely empty by late morning.

For the vast majority of fans in attendance, this was something they had never experienced in their lifetimes. It had been 55 long years since England was last in a major international final and fans have known only heartache and disappointment since that World Cup triumph in 1966.

One couple considered it such a momentous occasion that they decided to get married on Wembley Way just hours before kick off, both dressed in full wedding attire and holding up England shirts with ""Mr"" and ""Mrs"" printed on the back.

Even when cheering on 'golden generations' of the past, England fans have never supported their national team with a fervor quite like this. Southgate and this group of players deserve much of the credit for stirring up such a feeling of national pride.

Fans provided an electric atmosphere inside Wembley before kick off.

Stars have regularly used their platform to speak out on social issues and, when it comes to Rashford's fight against child food poverty, have even managed to reverse government policy.

""I think we've got good players and ice boys, but more importantly relatable boys,"" English journalist Darren Lewis tells CNN. ""I think the secret to the success of this team is that the people in charge of the England team -- and I mean the PR team around them -- have allowed them to speak on issues that affect them, on issues that people can connect with.

""They've allowed them to be normal. I remember being at the 2010 World Cup and England were keeping their players away from everyone, treating them like rock stars. I remember going down to the harbor in South Africa and the Dutch were walking around -- they were finalists that year -- walking around, talking to people, just enjoying themselves.

""I think this regime who are looking after the team, they realize that it's important just to let the players be players, let them be men who people can connect with. If you walk through some parts of the crowd, I remember doing it after games and being struck by the diversity in the crowd; black, brown, white.

""Everyone wants to be a part of this England because they identify with [Raheem] Sterling, [Harry] Kane, [Tyrone] Mings, [Jordan] Henderson. They identify with these players because these players aren't detached. They care about their communities. They care about the people in the places that they come from and that means a lot to the general public.""

Anyone but England?

However, that feeling of goodwill towards the national team seems to extend no further than England's borders.

Ahead of the final, viral memes have shown a map of Europe covered in Italian flags to signify the support of every other country on the continent.

Much of the animosity towards England and its fans seems to have stemmed from the chant of ""football's coming home,"" the chorus of the 1996 song 'Three Lions' which has become the national team's adopted anthem.

The song was released ahead of Euro 96, hosted in England, and is about pessimism and despair, but still feeling hope that the national team may finally end years of heartache.

The Red Arrows fly overhead during the opening ceremony.

However, fans of rival countries have interpreted the chant as arrogant and presumptuous, despite multiple attempts to explain its true meaning.

""First of all, there is this 'It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming' that's banging [on] since the beginning,"" Italian journalist Tancredi Palmeri told CNN.

""At the beginning it was nice, but then it sounds like: 'You owe us,' like 'it belongs to us, so you owe us' and people would say: 'No, nobody owes you anything and it doesn't belong to you.

""Just look at the footage of people singing all the time 'It's coming home' for a month. It doesn't really look like, 'we are being ironic, being sarcastic.' It looks like, 'finally we are getting back what is ours.' So that is the sentiment [from the outside].""

Some fans outside the stadium certainly didn't endear themselves to the watching world when they broke through the security barriers in an attempt to get into Wembley before the gates had been opened.

Fast start

In the hour leading up to kick off, Wembley was thundering.

Large swathes of English and Italian fans were mingling throughout the stadium, joining in chorus to belt out a number of songs that have become English anthems during Euro 2020.

By the time the national anthems came around, neither of which were booed by opposition fans, Wembley felt as though its very foundations were rocking.

When Shaw scored, then, with less than two minutes on the clock, the 60,000 or so fans inside the stadium raised the decibels to levels this ground has never heard before.

Luke Shaw connects with Kieran Trippier's cross to open the scoring.

It was a wonderful move, too, with Shaw getting on the end of Kieran Trippier's deep cross to the far post to finish off a rapid counterattack.

England certainly hasn't thrilled with attacking football at this European Championships, instead its success has been built on an organized defense -- the best in the tournament -- and a smothering midfield.

However, the players perhaps sensed this was an occasion like no other and put Italy on the back foot from the first whistle.

Throughout Euro 2020, this Italian team has somewhat torn up the defensive blueprints that the country's national team has become synonymous with over the years.

Though it still boasts tremendous defensive leadership and organization in veteran central pairing Bonucci and Gorgio Chiellini, it's been the more fluid and aggressive attacking style that has caught the eye.

In the first 25 minutes of this contest, however, they had been stifled entirely by an England team that wasn't affording them a moment's rest on the ball.

On the rare occasion Italy did enjoy any extended period of possession, boos rang loudly around the stadium and when a foray forward was ended by a wayward pass, England's fans erupted into rapturous cheers.

Shaw's goal sent Wembley wild.

Italy was still showing brief flashes of the exciting football that had got it this far -- notably through the quick-footed Lorenzo Insigne -- but its players were quickly met with a solid white wall whenever they threatened to fashion a sight of goal.

Mancini's side did create one opening before the half was over through Federico Chiesa, the goal hero from Italy's semifinal win over Spain, who picked up the ball from deep and drove towards the box, but could only drag his shot wide of Jordan Pickford's post.

Before the roar that greeted the referee's half time whistle, for the first time all evening Wembley had quietened down significantly; the first half had gone as perfectly as these fans could have dreamed of, perhaps they were already nervously allowing themselves to believe.

Italy rallies

Less than five minutes into the second half, however, Insigne fired a direct free-kick not too far wide of Pickford's post just as a prompt reminder that this match was far from over.

With Italy still struggling to create anything from open play, Mancini was forced into making a double substitution after only 50 minutes, bringing on Bryan Cristante and Domenico Berardi for Nicolo Barella the ineffective Ciro Immobile.

The changes had almost the immediate desired impact, as Italy for the first time got in behind England's back line but Insigne's shot from a narrow angle was well blocked by Pickford.

That chance rallied the Italian fans congregated behind Pickford's goal, who had fallen largely silent after their team's lackluster first half.

This was now without question Italy's best period of the match so far, for the first time its passing was starting to pull the English defense from one side to another to force some openings.

England soon retaliated, however, with John Stones rising highest in the area to head Trippier's corner towards goal and force Gianluigi Donnarumma to tip the ball over the crossbar.

Leonardo Bonucci celebrates after scoring Italy's equalizer.

But Italy soon got the goal its improved performance deserved.

Berardi's corner to the far post somehow found its way to Marco Verratti, who saw his shot saved excellently onto the post by Pickford, but Bonucci was in the right place at the right time to tap the rebound into an empty net.

Now it was the turn of the Italian fans to fill Wembley with noise, as England's supporters descended into a nervous silence with their team now on the back foot.

The minor capitulation forced Gareth Southgate into making his first substitutions, as Saka and Henderson replaced Trippier and Declan Rice.

It so nearly went from bad to worse for England as Bonucci's raking long ball found Berardi bearing down on goal, but the forward could only send his volley over the crossbar.

England now seemed to be doubting everything that had helped them reach the final; Maguire, normally assured in defense, hacked a desperate clearance away under no pressure at all, while Kane's passes began falling short of their desired target.

It was almost as if, for the first time all tournament, the magnitude of the occasion had finally started to dawn on these England players.

The game was on a knife edge as it entered the final 10 minutes, though Italian fans would certainly have been more confident than their English counterparts of snatching a win.

Extra time continued in much the same vein with neither side able to stamp its authority on proceedings, both perhaps too nervous to commit at this late stage.

28	28	"LONDON Two soccer-mad nations faced each other, and one blinked. Italy bested England in the final of the Euro 2020 soccer tournament Sunday in London.

The winner was determined by a penalty-kick shootout after extra time that kept the score even at 1. Italy won the shootout 3-2 after England's final shot was blocked.

Italian player Jorge Luiz Frello Filho, known as Jorginho, missed the previous shot, blocked by English goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, sending the London crowd into frenzied cheering, but a first-time European championship for the host country wasn't to be. Italy was already up 3-2, and the score remained.

As Covid-19 infection rates continue to rise across the U.K., more than 60,000 fans, most of them English, were allowed to watch the game at Wembley stadium.

The game started quickly as England's Luke Shaw scored just 2 minutes after kickoff the earliest goal in a European Championship final. But Italy came out of halftime aggressive and tied things up when Leonardo Bonucci bundled the ball into England's net after a goal line scramble.

Players from both teams took a knee before the starting whistle to bring attention to racial injustice, which England players did before every game of the tournament. Minutes earlier, dozens of ticketless fans broke into the stadium, with stewards and police trying to hold back the rowdy crowd as they pushed through barriers.

Prince William, his wife, Kate, and their son Prince George attended the game, the first soccer final played by the England men's team since 1966.

The tournament ' originally scheduled for last summer ' captivated the U.K. and Italy, which were both hit hard by Covid-19.

The U.K.'s four nations, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, have the highest Covid-19 death toll in Europe, followed by Italy, according to Johns Hopkins University. Although more than half of the British population has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the highly transmissible delta variant has led to a surge in cases in recent weeks.

Italy has been celebrating a dual sporting success as Matteo Berrettini became the first Italian tennis player 'man or woman' to appear in the Wimbledon singles tennis final, which he lost to Novak Djokovic of Serbia.

Across the U.K., millions tuned in for the game on both the BBC and its commercial rival ITV, which attracted more than 26 million viewers for England's semifinal against Denmark on Wednesday. Around the same number of people in the U.K. watched William and Kate get married in 2011.

Thousands of schoolchildren were given permission to go in late on Monday so they could enjoy the game with their parents. There had also been calls for a public holiday if England won.

Goodwill toward the team in England was largely unanimous, a change from the start of the tournament, when some fans booed a decision by England's players to take the knee.

""More than half of the England squad have at least one parent or grandparent born outside the U.K.,"" according to the Migration Museum in central London.

The squabble over the team's decision was fueled in part by the reaction of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who did not explicitly condemn the booing. Before the tournament kicked off last month, his spokesman said that when it came to taking a knee, he believed ""in taking action rather than just making gestures.""

Johnson, who has since been pictured in an England jersey, wished the team good luck. Several other members of his Conservative Party expressed their support, having previously criticized the team for taking the knee.

We're all hoping you can go one better and bring it home tonight @England.

England's captain, Harry Kane, was also praised for wearing a rainbow arm band in solidarity with the German team, which stood up for LGBTQ rights when it played Hungary earlier in the tournament. Hungary had faced international criticism for a law that bans the promotion of homosexuality or transgender issues in schools, seemingly conflating them with pedophilia.

When England's men's team last won a major international soccer tournament, the World Cup, more than half a century ago in 1966, it beat what was then West Germany at Wembley Stadium.

Queen Elizabeth II, who presented the trophy that year, recalled that moment Saturday in a message to England's manager, Gareth Southgate.

In a message to the team, she said she hoped ""that history will record not only your success but also the spirit, commitment and pride with which you have conducted yourselves."""	NBC News	Italy Euro 2020	Sport	12/07/2021	Target	https://nbcnews.to/3yFpSGe
29	29	"Italy defeats England in UEFA Euro 2020 final in penalty kick shootout

LONDON (AP) - Italian soccer's redemption story is complete. England's painful half-century wait for a major title goes on.

And it just had to be because of a penalty shootout.

Italy won the European Championship for the second time by beating England 3-2 on penalties on Sunday. The match finished 1-1 after extra time at Wembley Stadium, which was filled mostly with English fans hoping to celebrate the team's first international trophy since the 1966 World Cup.

It's coming to Rome. It's coming to Rome, Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci shouted into a TV camera amid the celebrations, mocking the famous lyric it's coming home from the England team's anthem.

For England, it was utter dejection again - they know the feeling so well when it comes to penalties - after Gianluigi Donnarumma, Italy's imposing goalkeeper, dived to his left and saved the decisive spot kick by 19-year-old Londoner Bukayo Saka, one of the youngest players in England's squad.

That was England's third straight failure from the penalty spot in the shootout, with Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho - players brought on late in extra time seemingly as specialist penalty-takers - also missing.

As Saka and Sancho cried, Donnarumma was mobbed by his teammates as they sprinted toward him from the halfway line at the end of the second penalty shootout in a European Championship final.

Then Italy's jubilant players headed to the other end of the field and ran as one, diving to the ground in front of the Italian fans who have witnessed a rebirth of their national team.

It was less than four years ago that Italy plunged to the lowest moment of its soccer history by failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in six decades. Now, they are the best team in Europe and on a national-record 34-match unbeaten run under Roberto Mancini, their suave coach who has won an international trophy in his first attempt to add to the country's other European title - in 1968 - and its four World Cups.

Mancini joined his players on the podium as Italy captain Giorgio Chiellini lifted the Henri Delaunay trophy to the backdrop of fireworks and tickertape.

It was impossible even to just consider this at one stage, Mancini said, but the guys were just amazing. I have no words for them.

For England, it's the latest heartache in shootouts at major tournaments, after defeats in 1990, 1996, 1998, 2004, 2006 and 2012. They ended that losing streak by beating Colombia on penalties in the round of 16 at the 2018 World Cup, but the pain has quickly returned.

The boys couldn't have given more, England captain Harry Kane said. Penalties are the worst feeling in the world when you lose. It's been a fantastic tournament - we should be proud, hold our heads up high. It's going to hurt now, it's going to hurt for a while.

EURO 2020 FINAL: Fans without tickets storm into Wembley Stadium

England's first major final in 55 years had all started so well, too, with Luke Shaw scoring the fastest goal in a European Championship final by meeting a cross from opposite wing back Kieran Trippier with a half-volley that went in off the post in the second minute.

It was Shaw's first goal for England and it prompted a fist-pump between David Beckham and Tom Cruise in the VIP box amid an explosion of joy around Wembley, which had at least 67,000 fans inside. Maybe more, given dozens of ticketless England fans managed to barge their way past stewards and police and into the stadium in unsettling scenes before kickoff.

That was the only time Italy's famously robust defense was really opened up in the entire 120 minutes.

Indeed, after Shaw's goal, England barely saw the ball for the rest of the game.

Italy's midfielders dominated possession, as widely predicted before the match, and England simply resorted to dropping deep and getting nine or even all 10 outfield players behind the ball. It was reminiscent of the 2018 World Cup semifinals, when England also scored early against Croatia then spent most of the game chasing its opponent's midfield before losing in extra time.

Italy's equalizer was merited and Bonucci was the unlikely scorer. He put the ball in from close range after a right-wing corner was flicked on to Marco Verratti, whose stooping header was tipped onto the post by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.

England managed to hold on for extra time - the way three of the last six European finals went - and actually had the better of the final stages.

Just not the shootout, again.

After the misses of Rashford - he stuttered up to the ball and then hit the post - and Sancho, whose shot was saved by Donnarumma again down to his left, Jorginho had the chance to win it for Italy.

Incredibly, the midfielder who converted the decisive penalty in a shootout win over Spain in the semifinals also failed to score as Pickford tipped the effort off the post.

It was Donnarumma who then made the crucial saves and within minutes he had also been named player of the tournament, the first goalkeeper to be so honored.

So instead of coming home, the trophy is headed to Rome.

We'd heard it day in, day out from Wednesday night - we heard it would be coming home to London, Bonucci said. I'm sorry for them, but the cup will be taking a nice flight, making its way to Rome so Italians all over the world can savor this."	USA Today	Italy Euro 2020	Sport	12/07/2021	Target	https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/europe/2021/07/11/uefa-euro-2020-italy-beats-england-penalty-kick-shoutout/7932786002/
30	30	"England's bid to end their 55-year wait for a major trophy ended in the familiar agony of defeat in a penalty shootout as Italy claimed the Euro 2020 crown at Wembley.

On a night of anticipation, tension and ultimate heartbreak in a feverish atmosphere, England looked on course for their most joyous day since 30 July 1966 when Luke Shaw gave them the perfect start after two minutes.

Italy, unbeaten in 33 matches before this final, slowly edged their way back into the game and were level in the 67th minute when Leonardo Bonucci pounced after England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford turned Marco Verratti's header on to a post.

And after a tense period of extra time failed to find a winner, it was on to penalties and bitter disappointment for England manager Gareth Southgate and his players, who had gone into this final on a wave of expectation and high emotion.

England missed three of their five penalties, Marcus Rashford hitting a post and Gianluigi Donnarumma denying Jadon Sancho before - so cruelly for such a fine young player - Arsenal teenager Bukayo Saka also saw the giant Italy goalkeeper save his spot-kick.

Harry Kane and Harry Maguire scored for England but, while Pickford kept hopes alive with saves from Andrea Belotti and Jorginho, Domenico Berardi, Bonucci and Federico Bernardeschi scored for Italy.

The tearful 19-year-old Saka, who showed such courage to step forward, was consoled by his team-mates and manager, but there was no real consolation for them or the expectant fans packed into Wembley.

England come up short as Italy triumph

England's years of hurt go on but it looked for the first 30 minutes of this final that the moment the country has waited more than 20,000 days for had finally arrived.

Southgate's side came firing out of the blocks and the manager's one change - replacing Saka with Kieran Trippier - paid an instant dividend as Trippier ran on to Kane's perfect pass to find the onrushing Shaw at the far post and he slammed an emphatic finish past Donnarumma.

England were up and running and urged on by a vast, frenzied crowd they had this talented, streetwise Italian side on the back foot until they suddenly gained a foothold in the closing phase of the first half.

Italy dominated possession, and it was no surprise when they restored parity, then looking the more likely winners as Southgate's side, so full of running early on, started to labour, particularly after losing the outstanding Declan Rice to a knock.

Southgate surprisingly waited until extra time to introduce Jack Grealish but by that stage the game was locked on course for penalties and so it proved.

Sancho and Rashford came on in the closing moments, presumably in readiness for penalties, but sadly for Southgate, who has got so much right in Euro 2020, this was one move that did not pay off as both failed with their spot-kicks.

Pickford performed heroics to save two penalties but he was also left in tears after England's fate was sealed.

Italy edged over the line and both Southgate and his players looked devastated as they took sympathetic applause from England's fans, who had arrived with such high hopes but filed out of Wembley with their dreams of a major trophy shattered once more.

England came close when they reached the semi-final of the World Cup in Moscow in 2018 but this loss will cut even deeper after they made such smooth progress to the final and had the chance to finally claim a second trophy in what was effectively a home tournament with its climax at Wembley.

They have made progress - but still England could not clear the final hurdle.

Improving England offer real hope

Southgate has led England to a World Cup semi-final and now a European Championship final in the last two tournaments

England's loss will be felt deeply after such impressive progress through the knockout stage with wins against Germany, Ukraine and Denmark.

Southgate must now digest whether he got it right in the final when it came to his approach, substitutions and penalty-takers but when the dust settles England can reflect on progress made.

England took one step further than they did in Russia and Southgate now has a potent blend of youth and experience to work with as he plots a course to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Saka came of age in this tournament while England have exciting young in the shape of Sancho, Phil Foden, Mason Mount and Jude Bellingham, augmented by Grealish.

Raheem Sterling had had a stellar campaign, Kane showed flashes of his world-class ability and the central defensive pair of John Stones and Maguire were solid. Pickford also made an outstanding contribution in goal.

This will offer no comfort in the hours following such a devastating loss, but England can at least move forward with optimism.

Italy worthy winners

Italy have won their sixth major tournament title (four World Cup, two Euros); among European nations, only Germany (seven) have won more

As Italy's players and staff celebrated in front of their exultant fans, manager Roberto Mancini was left to reflect on an outstanding job, their 34th game unbeaten crowned with the Euro 2020 title.

Mancini has put together an impressive mix of youth and experience, and at the back he can still rely on those two old warhorses of Juventus and Italy, Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini, as durable as ever despite a combined age of 70.

Italy proved their pedigree with wins over Belgium and Spain in the knockout stage and were unfazed by having to face a thunderous Wembley packed with England fans.

And all done after failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, which was regarded as a national sporting humiliation.

Now Italy are back as the winners of Euro 2020, testimony to the work of Mancini and his players.

Italy end long wait - the stats

Italy have won their second European Championship title, and first in 53 years (also 1968); it's the longest ever gap between championships in the tournament by a single nation, surpassing Spain's 44-year wait from 1964 to 2008.

England have won just 22% (two of nine) of their major tournament shootouts (World Cup/Euros), the lowest ratio of any European nation to have been involved in three or more.

Italy found themselves trailing in a game for the first time at Euro 2020, while overall they spent 65 minutes behind against England in the final, 21 more than they had been behind in their 33-game unbeaten run (in all competitions) coming into the final (44).

England posted their lowest possession in a game at Wembley (34.4%) since November 2016 v Spain (34.3%).

Gareth Southgate has made at least one change to the England starting XI for 37 consecutive matches, making a total of 200 changes in that time and last staying with the same starting line-up in the 2018 World Cup semi-final.

At one minute 57 seconds, Luke Shaw's opener (his first ever goal for England) was the quickest goal scored in the final of the European Championship, while it was also England's quickest in the competition overall and the earliest Italy have ever conceded in the competition.

At 34 years and 71 days, Italy's Leonardo Bonucci became the oldest player ever to score in a European Championship final, and second-oldest for a European side in any major tournament final (World Cup/Euros), after Nils Liedholm for Sweden v Brazil at the 1958 World Cup (35 years, 264 days).

Against Italy, Harry Kane failed to muster a shot or create a goal-scoring chance for only the second time in his 61 appearances for England, also doing so in a friendly against Switzerland in September 2018.

31	31	"Italy won the European Championship for the first time since 1968 as goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma saved two England penalties en route to a 3-2 shoot-out win.

Both sides had fought out a 1-1 extra-time draw at a raucous Wembley on Sunday.

The giant keeper saved from Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka after Marcus Rashford hit the post, as Federico Bernardeschi, Leonardo Bonucci and Domenico Berardi all scored for the Italians.

Luke Shaw had given England a dream start with a superb goal after two minutes but Italy, who offered almost nothing in response in the first half, gradually took command as the hosts sat back and leveled through Bonucci after 67 minutes.

It was the first final to be decided on penalties since Czechoslovakia beat West Germany in 1976 and will be wildly celebrated in Italy after they lost in the final in 2000 and 2012.

They made most of the running after halftime and in extra time and England can have few complaints after their early promise faded away.

It was nevertheless heartbreaking for most of the 67,000 Wembley crowd as England came up short in their first major final since they won the World Cup 55 years ago.

It had all started so well when Harry Kane spread the ball wide to Kieran Trippier and he instantly repaid coach Gareth Southgateâ€™s faith in recalling him by sending over a curling deep cross that the fast-arriving Shaw met on the half volley to hammer inside the post for his first international goal.

England had taken an early lead in their 2018 World Cup semi-final against Croatia before eventually being outplayed and beaten in extra time, but they did not look like giving up the initiative on home soil, playing on the front foot, though failing to threaten Donnarumma.

England keeper Jordan Pickford was similarly untroubled as Federico Chiesaâ€™s crisp shot went just wide and Ciro Immobileâ€™s blocked effort were all Italy had to show for a disjointed half.

Pickford was called into action after 57 minutes, blocking a Lorenzo Insigne shot and then getting down to palm away from Chiesa as Italy began to apply pressure, pinning England back.

It paid dividends when Bonucci pounced from close range after Pickford had turned Andrea Belottiâ€™s header onto a post.

It was a similar story in the first additional 15 minutes, though England did briefly force their way back into the game in the second period, albeit without either side creating anything to reward the crowd for their waves of noise.

So it went to penalties, where Englandâ€™s young guns failed and Italy took the glory.

England remains without a major trophy since 1966.

32	32	"Italy's prime minister announced Monday evening that he was expanding restrictions on travel to cover the entire country in an unprecedented peacetime move to try to stop the spread of coronavirus.

Giuseppe Conte said that a new government decree will require all Italians to meet a limited set of criteria -- such as a need to work or health conditions -- in order to travel outside the areas where they live.

He said the quarantine ordered by Rome in the north over the weekend was not enough and would have to be extended to the whole country, impacting the country's 60 million residents.

""There won't be just a red zone,"" Conte told reporters. ""There will be Italy.""

Italy registered 1,807 more confirmed cases as of Monday evening, for a national total of 9,172, the most cases of the virus outside of China. The number of dead in Italy also increased by 97 to 463.

Early Sunday, Conte signed a decree attempting to lock down 16 million people in Italy's prosperous north -- including the entire Lombardy region and 14 provinces in the Piemonte, Veneto and Emilia Romagna regions -- until April 3.

The newest measures extend school closures until April 3. Schools in Italy's center and south that were closed because of the virus were originally slated to re-open March 16.

Conte also criticized young people who have continued to gather to drink and have a good time amid a public health crisis. Under the previous decree, pubs, bars and restaurants in the affected area were ordered to close at dusk. The early hours now apply to all of Italy.

""This nightlife ... we can't allow this anymore,"" he said.

The measures have caused confusion among Italians about who could travel where. The outbreak is also impacting Italy's justice system.

Authorities said Monday that six inmates in an Italian lockup died after they broke into the infirmary and overdosed on methadone. The inmates were protesting virus containment measures inside the prison.

Authorities said inmates climbed onto the roof of the San Vittore prison in Milan and held up a painted sheet reading “Indulto,” Italian for pardon. Measures to contain the spread of the virus have effectively ground the court system to a halt, increasing tensions among prisoners.

Italian doctors celebrated one small victory after the first patient diagnosed with the illness, a 38-year-old Unilever worker, was moved out of intensive care and began breathing on his own. But the virus' rapid spread was forcing them to operate like war-time medics, triaging patients to decide who would receive access to scarce ICU beds.

“Unfortunately we’re only at the beginning,” said Dr. Massimo Galli, head of infectious disease at Milan’s Sacco hospital.

Travelers at Milan’s main train station had to sign police forms self-certifying that they are traveling for ""proven work needs,’’ situations of necessity, health reasons or to return home. They also needed to provide identity documents, contact numbers and an exact reason for travel from the financial hub.

Across Italy, museums and archaeological sites were closed, weddings were canceled and restaurants were told to keep patrons more than 3 feet apart. Officials ordered ski lifts across the country to close, even those outside the quarantine zone, after students whose classes were canceled began organizing trips to winter resorts.

Pope Francis celebrated Mass alone at the Vatican hotel where he lives, live-streaming the event, but he did resume some meetings.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

Conte said Monday night that a new government decree will require people throughout the country of 60 million to demonstrate a need to work, health conditions or other limited reasons to travel outside the areas where they live.

The restrictions will take effect Tuesday and, as in northern Italy, will last until April 3, he said.

“There won’t be just a ‘red zone,’” Conte told reporters, referring to the quarantine order he signed over the weekend that applied to a vast swath of northern Italy, with a population of 16 million.

“There will be Italy” as a protected area, he said.

The premier also took to task the young people in much of Italy who have been gathering at night to drink and have a good time during the public health emergency that started on Feb. 21.

“This nightlife ... we can’t allow this anymore,” Conte said.

Under the weekend decree that applied to regions in the north, pubs, restaurants and cafes are required to close at dusk. Now the mandatory early hours will affect all of a locked-down Italy.

More than 9,000 people have been infected by Covid-19 in Italy, where the total number of reported deaths jumped to 463 on Monday – an increase of over 25 per cent compared to the day before.

When asked about the possibility of halting mortgage payments on Radio Anch’io, Laura Castelli, the deputy economy minister, said: ”Yes, that will be the case, for individuals and households.”

The entire country was placed on lockdown on Tuesday morning, with all public gatherings cancelled, and universities and schools closed until next month.

Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, said that everyone in Italy would be confined to the area where they live unless they are able to demonstrate a need to work, health conditions, or other limited reasons in order to travel elsewhere.

The lockdown already in place for northern parts of the country, encompassing about 16 million people, has now been extended to the whole nation.

The restrictions are set to last until 3 April and those who break the rules risk up to three months in jail or fines of €206 (£180). ?

Bars, restaurants and cafes across Italy are also to close at dusk as the government works to limit the spread of Covid-19.

Chaos broke out at prisons nationwide on Monday as inmates protested anti-coronavirus measures, which included restrictions on normal family visits.

Locations affected by the lockdown include the financial hub Milan and the tourist destination of Venice and are subject to strict measures, including the closure of schools and universities and the cancellations of all public events, sports events and civil and religious ceremonies.

People who do not adhere to the restrictions, which are in place until April 3, will face up to three months in prison and a fine of 206 euros ($232).

A woman walks in the almost deserted Central Station in Milan on Sunday after the lockdown was imposed overnight.

But questions remain as to how it will be enforced as trains and planes continued to go to and from Milan as scheduled on Sunday.

""There will be an obligation to avoid any movement of people,"" Conte said Sunday as he announced the new measures. ""And even within the areas, moving around will occur only for essential work or health reasons.""

He added, ""We understand that these measures will impose sacrifices, sometimes small and sometimes very big. But this is a time where we must take responsibility. ... We need to understand that all of us need to adhere to the measures.""

Restrictions have also been imposed throughout the rest of Italy, including the suspension of events at cinemas, theaters, museums and sports arenas.

Schools and university classes will be suspended until March 15, and bars, restaurants and shops must observe a one-meter (3-foot) distance between patrons.

The sweeping move came after the country saw a dramatic spike of 1,247 confirmed cases on Saturday, the Civil Protection Department said in a statement.

Also, the president of the Italian region of Piedmont -- which is not under lockdown -- said Sunday that he tested positive for the virus. Alberto Cirio announced on a Facebook that he was in Rome last Wednesday for a meeting of Italian regions to discuss the outbreak.

Cirio tested himself as a precaution after Nicola Zingaretti, the head of the Lazio region, got a positive result for the virus.

As of Sunday evening, Italy has recorded 7,375 cases and 366 deaths, the most fatalities outside mainland China.

The restrictions could take a toll on Italy's already fragile economy.

The Pope gave a prayer via livestream

As the extraordinary response to the coronavirus affects almost every aspect of Italian life, Pope Francis delivered a livestream prayer from the Vatican.

He began his address saying that it was quite unusual for the Pope to be ""locked away.""

""We do this so that the close concentration of people won't spread the virus,"" he said via video, before praying for those suffering from the virus and those who are assisting them.

After the prayer, he appeared briefly at a window overlooking an almost empty St. Peter's Square for a weekly Sunday greeting to pilgrims.

The Pope's prayer was livestreamed in St. Peter's Square.

Vatican City reported its first coronavirus case on Friday, but the Vatican dispelled reports that Pope Francis had been tested for the virus, saying he only had a cold.

Meanwhile, churches in many cities in the north of Italy -- including Bologna, Turin and Venice -- suspended their Ash Wednesday services, with some offering Masses online or on local television.

Friar Alberto Grandi, who lives in the town of Casalpusterlengo in the Lombardy region, has been in quarantine in the ""red zone"" with a fever. Yet he remains in high spirits.

A square in Milan is nearly empty as people observe the restrictions.

During a video call with Friar Marcello Longhi and CNN in Milan, Grandi said the lockdown could lead to more babies being conceived as couples stay at home.

As the lockdown began, many Italians were confused about what it would entail or whether they could return home. Michele De Marsico told CNN at a Milan train station Sunday that he was trying to figure out how to return to southern Italy.

""I was worried, so I came here to the train station to check out the situation,"" the 55-year-old told CNN.

The restrictions could take a toll on Italy's already fragile economy. At the end of February, Italian tourism representatives issued a news release warning that 200 million euros ($260 million) in bookings had been canceled for March since the outbreak was first announced.

Hotel worker Alice Baldisserri, 38, told CNN that ""Milan's hotels are empty, so the jobs are at risk."" Baldisserri said Italy's tourism industry has clearly been ""hit the hardest"" by the outbreak.

36	36	"Ryanair is sharply cutting back on the number of flights it operates to and from northern Italy after the government’s lockdown of provinces in response to the coronavirus.

The airline’s announcement came after British Airways and easyJet cancelled more flights to northern Italy and offered refunds or rebooking after the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to regions operating coronavirus quarantine restrictions.

Ryanair will operate a maximum of one service a day, from Fridays to Mondays, on its routes from the region. It will also suspend all Italian domestic flights to and from Bergamo, Malpensa, Parma and Treviso airports, which are located in the lockdown area.

Flights are able to continue and foreign nationals in Italy are free to depart despite the decree from Italian authorities banning the population of Lombardy and other provinces from leaving the region. However, a number of EU countries, including Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Malta and Romania are restricting flights from northern Italy.

British Airways cancelled dozens of UK flights to and from Milan and Venice and is reviewing its schedules for the coming weeks, having already cancelled hundreds of other flights.

Any passengers due to fly with BA on Monday were offered a full refund, while those who have booked to fly until 2 April can postpone for up to eight weeks or travel via Switzerland.

EasyJet said it was reviewing its schedules for Milan, Verona and Venice up until the Easter holidays and had cancelled a number of flights to those airports on Monday. Passengers were given the option of a full refund or rebooking.

A spokesman said: “We expect to continue to reduce the number of flights in and out of Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Venice and Verona airports in the period up to 3 April and will provide a further update on our schedule in due course. Whilst these circumstances are outside of our control, we apologise to all affected customers for any inconvenience caused.”

With demand for travel dropping worldwide, more airlines have offered guarantees to allow passengers to book with confidence. BA is allowing customers booking flights anywhere on its network to change their flight without a fee in the next 12 months.

Air France-KLM extended a similar guarantee on Monday, allowing customers booking anywhere on its network in March to postpone flights at no extra cost until the end of May. Passengers wanting to postpone for longer or to change their destination or cancel will be offered a non-refundable voucher for future travel.

While some countries have banned airlines from flying in from Italy, the UK government is unlikely to introduce any such measure and has indicated it is a matter for airlines as private businesses."

The country is the hardest hit outside of Asia with more than 7,300 reported infections, up from about 1,700 a week ago. With the death toll leaping by more than 50% in one day from 233 to 366, the race to save each life has become a military operation, CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports.

The quarantine includes the financial capital of Milan and Venice, one of Italy's main tourist draws. Areas outside of the lockdown are also taking precautions.

The country's beloved soccer games are being played behind closed doors without any fans.

At the Vatican, Pope Francis livestreamed his Sunday blessing on wide screens instead of at his papal apartment window to discourage crowds from gathering — though he did make a surprise appearance when it was over.

In a Rome suburb, the faithful celebrated mass outdoors and adhered to the government advice that members of the public should stay three feet away one another.

""We keep a safe distance, so we can pray together,"" said one parishioner Guido Rocca. ""But given the problems nowadays, it is important that we pray together.""

Nationwide, museums have largely been closed, and for the first time since the coronavirus crisis began, the Colosseum is being shut down.

38	38	"The data posted online suggest that levels of antibodies that can target the Delta variant grow fivefold in people 18 to 55 who get a third dose of the vaccine.

Among people ages 65 to 85, the Pfizer data suggest that antibody levels that should protect against Delta grow 11-fold more than following a second dose.

The data, which involved tests of 23 people, have not yet been peer-reviewed or published.

It's not clear if boosted antibody levels actually correlate to better protection, or if that extra protection is even needed. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current vaccines protect people well against all the common variants.

During a company earnings call on Wednesday morning, Dr. Mikael Dolsten, who leads worldwide research, development and medical for Pfizer, called the new data on a third dose of vaccine ""encouraging.""

""Receiving a third dose more than six months after vaccination, when protection may be beginning to wane, was estimated to potentially boost the neutralizing antibody titers in participants in this study to up to 100 times higher post-dose three compared to pre-dose three,"" Dolsten said in prepared remarks . ""These preliminary data are very encouraging as Delta continues to spread.""

The data also show that antibody levels are much higher against the original coronavirus variant and the Beta variant, first identified in South Africa, after a third dose.

Separately, Pfizer and its partner BioNtech released new safety and efficacy data for their coronavirus vaccine Wednesday, and said it shows protection holds up for at least six months, although it may start to wane slightly towards the end of that time.

The pre-print paper, posted Wednesday to the online server medrxiv.org, updates results from Pfizer's trial involving 44,000 volunteers around the world.

It found the overall efficacy was about 91% during the six months. Vaccine efficacy against severe Covid-19 was about 97%, the data show. The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed nor published in a journal.

The data show that the vaccine's efficacy peaked at more than 96% from a week to around two months after receiving a second dose of vaccine, and then appeared to gradually decline to 83.7% four to six months later, with an average decline of about 6% over the last two months.

Earlier this month, Pfizer announced it has seen waning immunity from its coronavirus vaccine, saying it is picking up its efforts to develop a third dose that will protect people from variants. The company also specified it would seek emergency use authorization under the US Food and Drug Administration for a third dose in August.

But in an unusual move, the FDA and CDC said at the time Americans don't need third doses quite yet and that it was not up to companies alone to decide when an additional dose might be needed.

US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy repeated that point Wednesday morning, telling CNN's Poppy Harlow, ""People do not need to go out and get a booster shot.""

Also, there is much more to the immune system than antibodies.

For instance, experts say it remains unclear how antibody levels correlate with real-world immunity, and to what extent other parts of the immune system -- such as B cells and T cells -- could factor into protection.

Pfizer to submit third-dose vaccine data to FDA soon

Pfizer said it anticipates submitting data on a third dose of its coronavirus vaccine to the FDA as soon as next month, Dolsten said during Wednesday's earnings call.

""We are in ongoing discussions with regulatory agencies regarding a potential third-dose booster of the current vaccine and, assuming positive results, anticipate an emergency use authorization submission as early as August,"" Dolsten said.

In order for third doses to be administered to people in the United States, the emergency use authorization that the FDA issued for the vaccine would either need to be amended or, if the vaccine were fully FDA approved, a third dose could be given off label.

""We continue to believe it is likely that a third-dose booster may be needed within six to 12 months after full vaccination to maintain the highest level of protection, and studies are underway to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a third dose,"" Dolsten said, adding that data suggest antibody levels appear to decline around eight months after receiving a second dose of vaccine.

""Pending regulatory approval, we also plan to start an immunogenicity and safety study in August to evaluate an updated version of our vaccine specifically designed to target the Delta variant,"" Dolsten said.

He mentioned how the Delta variant is the ""most transmissible"" yet seen and now represents about 83% of sequenced Covid-19 cases in the United States.

Surgeon general: 'People do not need to go out and get a booster shot'

At this point, the decision on if and when booster shots are necessary will be made by agencies such as the FDA and CDC, Murthy said on CNN on Wednesday.

""This data from Pfizer, we've been in talks with them about what they're seeing with regard to their studies related to boosters,"" Murthy said, when asked about Pfizer's new data. ""But at this point, I want to be very clear: People do not need to go out and get a booster shot.""

Murthy said government agencies would be ""looking at the whole breadth of data that will come from companies, that will come from cohorts that the CDC is now following, where they're tracking whether or not there is any waning in immunity or increase in breakthrough rates.

""Ultimately, that collective information is what will drive any decision about boosters.""

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Murthy also said that the question of whether it was ethical for a third booster shot to be recommended while there is a major vaccine supply shortage in the developing world was a ""critical question"" because the ability to reduce the likelihood of future variants depends on tamping down spread of the virus around the world.

""We as a country have a vested interest in getting the rest of the world vaccinated,"" Murthy said. ""It's one of the reasons why we don't want to have to choose between giving our population boosters, if it's required, and vaccinating the rest of the world.""

This is why the United States is making sure it is increasing manufacturing capacity in other countries, he said, working with vaccine companies such as Pfizer and Moderna to ensure they are producing more for the rest of the world and donating excess supply to other countries."

Pfizer anticipates applying for emergency use authorization for a third dose of its vaccine as soon as next month.

WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- American biopharmaceutical company Pfizer said Wednesday a third dose of its COVID-19 vaccine can ""strongly"" boost protection against the Delta variant.

Antibody levels against the Delta variant in people aged 18 to 55 who receive a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are greater than five-fold than following a second dose, according to data posted at the company's teleconference.

Among people aged 65 to 85, the Pfizer data suggest that antibody levels against the Delta variant after receiving a third dose are greater than 11-fold than following a second dose.

40	40	"The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine waned over six months, but experts say the data still don't point to an immediate need for booster shots.

The study, which hasn't yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal, found that the vaccine was 97 percent effective at preventing severe disease from Covid-19 for at least six months — but the effectiveness against any symptomatic illness fell from 96 percent to 84 percent in the same period, falling by about 6 percent every two months.

Full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic

""I was generally encouraged by the results of the paper,"" said the lead study author, Dr. Stephen Thomas, a coordinating investigator for the Pfizer vaccine trial and director of the SUNY Upstate Institute for Global Health & Translational Science in New York.

He said the expectation was always that the vaccine's protection was going to wane. The big question, he said, was whether it would wane to a degree that would affect the so-called public health burden of the disease, specifically hospitalizations and deaths. So far, that doesn't appear to be the case.

""Even though we saw that at six months there was a waning of protection, there was a maintenance of protection against those severe outcomes that really make up the public health burden of the disease,"" Thomas said.

Overall, the study found that the vaccine was 91 percent effective at preventing any symptoms of Covid-19, from mild to severe, over six months. Pfizer announced that finding in a news release in April.

Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said he was ""positively surprised"" that the effectiveness was as high as it was for preventing symptoms.

""This data is all really encouraging and exactly what you'd expect,"" he said.

""You're never going to be able to protect as well against asymptomatic infection or mildly symptomatic infection, and that's OK,"" he said. ""You just want to keep people out of the hospital and keep them from dying. That's the goal.""

The new research looked at follow-up data gathered through March 13 on the more than 44,000 people who participated in Pfizer's Phase 3 clinical trial last year. People received either two doses of the vaccine or two doses of a placebo three weeks apart. Because the study looked at data only through mid-March, it remains unclear how the shots fare against the delta variant, which became the most common strain of the virus in the U.S. early this month.

Experts continue to consider whether booster shots will be necessary. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has long said a booster would be needed in the coming months, although federal health officials say there's not yet evidence to say it's warranted.

In an earnings call Wednesday morning, Pfizer said a third dose increased levels of antibodies specific to the delta variant fivefold in people ages 18 to 55 and elevenfold in those 65 to 85. Although the findings suggest better protection against the variant, more research is needed to determine whether that translates to better protection against illness.

Offit stressed that because the vaccine remains very effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalizations, it's too early to definitively say booster shots will be required.

""If the numbers climb to 5, 10 or 20 percent of people who are fully vaccinated and are still hospitalized or killed, then you can start thinking about a booster, but we're not there yet,"" he said.

Dr. Bob Wachter, chairman of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, agreed that the new data don't suggest it's time to rush out and get booster shots yet.

""This just shows that someone who has got their shots seven or eight months ago is at a little bit higher risk"" for a breakthrough infection ""than we thought, and it's a perfectly good justification for even vaccinated people to go back to wearing masks indoors,"" Wachter said, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision Tuesday to recommend that vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas with high levels of community spread.

But the dominance of the delta variant, combined with waning effectiveness of the vaccine over time, suggests that boosters will be needed at some point, he said.

""I don't think it's grounds for panic, and I don't think it's grounds to run out and find a booster today, because the overall protection against getting super sick and dying remains extraordinarily high,"" Wachter said. ""But I do think it is one piece of the puzzle that says to all of us boosters are going to be in our future.""

Thomas, the study author, said more research is needed.

""I think [the study] says that there is a possibility that we may need booster doses if the protective efficacy of the vaccine continues to decline over time,"" Thomas said. ""But that to me is still an unanswered question.""

41	41	"If third shots are cleared for the general population, the boosters would likely represent a multi-billion-dollar business for Pfizer.

In a study posted online but not yet peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal, Pfizer and BioNTech scientists reported that the vaccine had a sky-high efficacy rate of about 96 percent against symptomatic Covid-19 for the first two months following the second dose. But the figure declined by about 6 percent every two months after that, falling to 83.7 percent after about four to six months.

Against severe disease, however, the vaccine’s efficacy held steady at about 97 percent.

“This drop is very slight — I wouldn’t say it’s waning,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. She did not see in the new study any evidence that boosters should go into use for the general population. “These data don’t support a need for that right now,” she said.

The findings fit with what scientists have learned about how the immune system fends off viruses. Antibodies are the only defense to prevent an infection, but their levels typically drop in the months after vaccination or recovery from the disease. If the coronavirus takes hold, immune cells can swoop in to destroy infected cells and make new antibodies.

That enduring defense produced by the vaccine may explain how the virus can sometimes breed in the nose — producing a cold or sore throat — but fail to reach the lung where it can cause serious disease."	The New York Times	Pfizer Delta	Science	28/07/2021	Target	https://nyti.ms/2V13Y1Z
42	42	"The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a new report Monday summarizing the latest authoritative scientific information about global warming. Here are five important takeaways.

Blaming humans

The report says almost all of the warming that has occurred since pre-industrial times was caused by the release of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Much of that is the result of humans burning fossil fuels — coal, oil, wood and natural gas.

Scientists say that only a fraction of the temperature rise recorded since the 19th century can have come from natural forces.

Paris goals

Almost all countries have signed up to the 2015 Paris climate accord that aims to limit global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) — and ideally no more than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) — by the year 2100, compared with the late 19th century.

Advertisement

The report’s 200-plus authors looked at five scenarios, all of which will see the world cross the 2.7-degree threshold in the 2030s — sooner than in previous predictions. Three of those scenarios will also see temperatures rise 3.6 degrees above the pre-industrial average.

Dire consequences

The 3,000-plus-page report concludes that ice melt and sea-level rise are already accelerating. Wild weather events — from storms to heat waves — are also expected to worsen and become more frequent.

Because further warming is “locked in” from the greenhouse gases humans have already released into the atmosphere, some changes will be “irreversible” for centuries even if emissions are drastically cut, the report said.

Some hope

While many of the report’s predictions paint a grim picture of humans’ impact on the planet and its looming consequences, the IPCC also found that so-called tipping points, such as catastrophic ice-sheet collapses and the abrupt slowdown of ocean currents, are “low likelihood,” though they cannot be ruled out.

Big catch

Meeting the most ambitious goal of the Paris accord — keeping temperature increases to 2.7 degrees by the end of the century — will only be possible through what are known as “negative emissions.” That means sucking more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than is added, something the report suggests could be done after 2050. The panel doesn’t explain how this can be done, though, and many scientists are skeptical that it’s possible."

43	43	"Irreversible changes, warmer temperatures sooner: 5 alarming findings from the UN climate change report

Show Caption Hide Caption New climate change report from the IPCC issues 'code red for humanity' The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change releases a new and devastating report on the danger climate change has on the world. USA TODAY, Associated Press

A grim global report on climate change released Monday paints a dire picture for the future of Earth.

Climate change has led to irreversible shifts for the next hundreds to thousands of years, according to the report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The effects of more extreme weather are felt across the globe, the report said, and average global temperature increases that could have devastating effects may come sooner than expected.

Dubbed a ""code red for humanity"" by the United Nations, the report says unequivocally humans have caused climate change, driven up greenhouse gas emissions and led to warmer weather.

'Code red for humanity': UN report gives stark warning on climate change, says wild weather events will worsen

Here are five of the most alarming findings in the climate report:

We may reach 1.5°C of warming much sooner than previously expected

""One of the most striking takeaways is that we may reach 1.5°C of warming a decade earlier than the IPCC had previously found,"" said Helen Mountford of the World Resources Institute.

Warming of 1.5 degrees Centigrade would increase heat waves, lengthen warm seasons and shorten cold seasons. If temperatures were 2 degrees warmer, heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health, the report says.

In five scenarios of expected levels of greenhouse gas emissions laid out in the report, global warming of at least 1.5 degrees is the best estimate for the increase in temperature in the near term, from 2021 to 2040. Even under the lowest emissions scenarios, the report says a 1.5-degree warming in the next 20 years is ""more likely than not"" before bouncing back. Previous predictions did not expect this level of warming this soon.

The five scenarios varied more in how much global temperatures will increase in the coming century, but even under a very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario, the range of temperature increase by 2100 is very likely to be 1 to 1.8 degrees Centigrade.

Human-caused climate change is already affecting 'every region across the globe'

No region of the globe has been spared from the impacts of climate change, the report says. Climate change is ""affecting many weather and climate extremes,"" such as heat, heavy precipitation and drought.

Since the IPCC's last assessment, the evidence of humans' influence on specific weather events has strengthened.

The report says extreme heat has become more frequent and more intense across most parts of the world since 1950. The IPCC asserts with ""high confidence"" that human-caused climate change is the main driver and that without human influence, some of the extreme highs would be ""extremely unlikely.""

Heavy precipitation has increased in frequency and intensity across most regions, the report said.

The report found the share of hurricanes that reach the devastating levels of Category 3 to 5 storms has probably increased over the past 40 years. Humans have increased the chances of extreme compound weather events, such as the frequency of concurrent droughts, fire weather and flooding.

Extreme weather will get worse

The report found a direct relation between increasing temperatures and extreme weather events. For every half a degree Centigrade warmer the average global temperature is, expect ""clearly discernible increases"" in extreme heat waves, heavy precipitation and droughts.

For example, hot temperature extremes that typically occurred only once every 10 years without human-caused climate change are likely to occur 4.1 times if temperatures increase by 1.5 degrees Centigrade. If temperatures increase by 2 degrees, a once-in-every-10-years extreme is likely to occur 5.6 times. Under a 4-degree warming scenario, the extreme heat occurs 9.4 times.

Each incremental increase in global temperature would lead to lower levels of Arctic sea ice, snow cover and permafrost.

Under all five emission scenarios the report lays out, the Arctic is likely to see at least one September month that is practically free of sea ice before 2050.

Many changes to Earth are irreversible for centuries and millennia

In a number of areas, greenhouse gas emissions have caused irreversible damage, and the effects will be felt on the time scale of centuries to millennia, according to the report.

The report says ocean temperature changes and ocean acidification, mountain and polar glacier melt and sea level rise are all expected to continue over the next hundreds of years regardless of human intervention.

Over the next 2,000 years, even if global temperatures are kept to a 1.5-degree increase, the average global sea level is expected to rise 2 to 3 meters.

The report says ice loss in Greenland over the 21st century is virtually certain and there is high confidence that ice loss will increase cumulative emissions.

As emissions and temperatures increase, Earth's water cycle becomes more intense

Earth's natural cycles are expected to be acutely effected by rising global temperatures and greenhouse gas emissions, the report says.

As the climate warms, Earth's water cycle will increasingly tend to more extremes. In some areas, that means wetter wet seasons and in others drier dry seasons, the report says.

Increased variability in rainfall tied to El Niño is very likely under three of the global emission scenarios.

The way Earth naturally combats increased carbon emissions is likely to be affected in the coming decades, the report says.

Earth's carbon sinks – generally its forests and oceans – will store an increasing amount of carbon under scenarios with higher emissions, but they will be less effective in the higher emission scenarios, the report says. As a result, higher levels of emissions will remain in the atmosphere.

44	44	"Climate change is changing Earth in ways that are ""unprecedented"" in thousands of years — and in some cases, hundreds of thousands of years — according to a blistering report released Monday by the United Nations.

The sobering assessment also found that some changes that are already playing out, such as warming oceans and rising sea levels, are ""irreversible for centuries to millennia.""

U.N. Secretary General António Guterres called the findings a ""code red for humanity,"" adding that the ""alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable.""

The report is the most comprehensive assessment from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 2013 and provides the strongest case yet for human-caused global warming, saying it's ""unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.""

The report also found that climate change is intensifying, occurring at an accelerated pace and is already affecting every region of the planet.

""It has been clear for decades that the Earth's climate is changing, and the role of human influence on the climate system is undisputed,"" Valérie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the IPCC's Working Group I, said in a statement.

Ko Barrett, the IPCC’s vice- chair and a senior climate adviser at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told NBC News that the report shows that no matter what humans do going forward, the future will be hotter than it is now.

""It can be kind of demoralizing or depressing to think that there are so many things that are kind of irreversible for a long period of time,"" Barrett said. ""But the good news is that, that these irreversible changes can be slowed down with rapid, strong and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.""

The IPCC, established in the late 1980s, consists of thousands of scientists across 195 member governments who pore over the most recent published and peer-reviewed research on global warming and compile the findings into a report on the current state of the climate. The assessment, which includes a look at the future risks and impacts of climate change, typically represents consensus within the scientific community. More than 230 authors contributed to the latest report.

The assessment comes less than three months before world leaders are set to convene from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland, for the 2021 U.N. Climate Change Conference. Countries are expected to set forth ambitious targets to reduce emissions by 2030, and the IPCC's findings will likely feature prominently in the discussions.

John Kerry, former secretary of state and the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, said in a statement that the report should compel leaders to take aggressive action to put the planet on a path toward net zero emissions by midcentury.

""What the world requires now is real action. All major economies must commit to aggressive climate action during this critical decade,"" he said. ""We can get to the low carbon economy we urgently need, but time is not on our side.""

The report states that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have caused global warming at a rate not seen in at least the past 2,000 years. It's estimated that human-caused climate change is responsible for approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming since 1850-1900, the earliest period with reliable measurements of global surface temperatures, the authors wrote.

What's more, the report found that global temperatures are expected to exceed 2 degrees Celsius of warming this century ""unless deep reductions in [carbon dioxide] and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades.""

""The report makes it very clear: If we want to limit warming to any level that is sort of manageable, you have to just cut back the emissions very deeply and immediately,"" said Corinne Le Quéré, a professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia in the U.K., who was not involved with the IPCC assessment.

While the findings are grim, she said, ""the responsibility to act is in our hands.""

Climate scientists have warned that the increase in average global temperatures should be limited to under 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, in order to avoid the most devastating effects of global warming. The 2-degree benchmark was set by climate negotiators in Copenhagen in 2009, but studies have increasingly found that the target may already be out of reach.

In a news briefing Monday, Inger Andersen, under-secretary-general of the United Nations and executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said the IPCC has been warning of the dangers of climate change for more than three decades, but that countries — especially the world's biggest economies that are responsible for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions — haven't done enough to address the problems.

""The world listened, but it didn’t hear,"" she said. ""The world listened, but it didn’t act strongly enough. As a result, climate change is a problem that is here, now. Nobody is safe. And it is getting worse faster.""

The new IPCC assessment goes further than any of the group's previous reports in linking human-caused climate change with increases in extreme weather events around the world.

""It is virtually certain that hot extremes (including heat waves) have become more frequent and more intense across most land regions since the 1950s, while cold extremes (including cold waves) have become less frequent and less severe,"" the authors wrote, adding that human-caused global warming is the ""main driver"" of those changes.

Recent events, including widespread drought in the western U.S., heat waves across Europe and North America and devastating wildfires in Greece, Turkey and the U.S., have highlighted the consequences of a warming world.

""The climate is behaving like an athlete on steroids,"" said Erich Fischer, a climate scientist at ETH Zürich and one of the authors of the IPCC assessment.

The report also details how the increasing ocean and surface temperatures will cause myriad physical changes in climate — including drought, heat waves, heavy rainfall and coastal flooding — in different regions of the planet.

The assessment is part of the IPCC's latest summary on climate change, called the Sixth Assessment Report or AR6, that will be published next year. The full report consists of four sections: the Working Group I report on the science of climate change; the Working Group II report on the vulnerabilities and socioeconomic impacts; the Working Group III report on possible ways to mitigate climate change; and the Synthesis Report, which reviews the findings from all the working groups and integrates relevant information for policymakers."

45	45	"A growing number of world leaders, including President Biden, have endorsed the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, though current policies in the major polluting countries are still far off-track from achieving that target. The 10 biggest emitters of greenhouse gases are China, the United States, the European Union, India, Russia, Japan, Brazil, Indonesia, Iran and Canada.

The new report leaves no doubt that humans are responsible for global warming, concluding that essentially all of the rise in global average temperatures since the 19th century has been driven by nations burning fossil fuels, clearing forests and loading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane that trap heat.

The changes in climate to date have little parallel in human history, the report said. The last decade is quite likely the hottest the planet has been in 125,000 years. The world’s glaciers are melting and receding at a rate “unprecedented in at least the last 2,000 years.” Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide have not been this high in at least 2 million years.

Ocean levels have risen 8 inches on average over the past century, and the rate of increase has doubled since 2006. Heat waves have become significantly hotter since 1950 and last longer in much of the world. Wildfire weather has worsened across large swaths of the globe. Bursts of extreme heat in the ocean — which can kill fish, seabirds and coral reefs — have doubled in frequency since the 1980s."

46	46	"(CNN) Lawmakers and top climate officials in President Joe Biden's administration sounded the alarm on Monday in response to a new report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, urging nations to swiftly limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

""If Senators truly followed the science in this report, we'd have 100 votes for climate action to match the 100 percent certainty that human-caused climate change is destroying our planet,"" Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts said in a statement. ""This report must be the final warning to the world that time has run out to save the planet from dangerous and irreversible climate change.""

The latest IPCC report finds the world is rapidly running out of time to keep human-caused global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The report lays out different scenarios if world nations decarbonize and collectively limit their warming to 1.5 degrees, compared to what will happen if they don't take action -- leading to global warming of 2 or 3 degrees Celsius. The latter would have catastrophic consequences for the planet, leading to already severe weather events like fires and flooding getting worse.

""Every bit of warming matters, and every bit of avoided warming matters,"" Dr. Jane Lubchenco, the deputy director for climate and environment at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told CNN. ""We have to enhance ambition and tackle the climate crisis like the existential threat that it is.""

With global warming currently at 1.1 degrees Celsius, this summer has already set new records for heat and drought in parts of the United States. Some lawmakers said they feared this summer could be tip of the iceberg.

""It's not as if this year we're experiencing is going to be a blip, it's going to be the best-case scenario if we don't make changes,"" Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota told CNN. ""Ranchers are liquidating their cattle herds because they can't find hay, part of the [Minnesota] boundary waters is closed off because of fire danger. I think about my grandson; is he even going to know snow in Minnesota?""

Smith and other lawmakers said the new report underscored the need for congressional Democrats to pass a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill including strong climate provisions, including tax credits for renewable energy, and a Clean Electricity Standard.

""We cannot afford to squander this once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver historic investments in clean energy, good-paying jobs, and environmental justice,"" said Rep. Kathy Castor, who chairs the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.

Top Senate Democrats released new details Monday on the climate provisions in their upcoming $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill, which would included a new Clean Electricity Payment Program, clean energy, manufacturing, and transportation tax incentives and grants, funding for a Civilian Climate Corps, new polluter fees on methane and carbon imports, and consumer rebates for home electrification and weatherization, among other things.

""By finally tackling climate change, we can spare our country and our planet the most devastating effects of global warming,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York wrote in a Dear Colleague letter.

Many lawmakers believe that passing a robust reconciliation bill is their best hope to achieve President Biden's goal of slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent relative to 2005 levels by 2030. Biden has also said he wants to get the United States to net-zero emissions by 2050, and decarbonize the US electricity sector by 2035.

""This is really a double wake-up call,"" said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. ""I think finally we're beginning to accept we've got to do something.""

The Biden administration on Monday also announced $5 billion in funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency aimed at helping states and localities prepare for ""extreme weather and climate-related disasters.""

That funding will go toward grants for communities to reduce vulnerability to natural hazard events, additional grants for hazard mitigation, and funding for flood mitigation grants, according to a news release.

""The world must come together before the ability to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is out of reach,"" said US Climate Envoy John Kerry in response to the IPCC report. ""What the world requires now is real action. We can get to the low carbon economy we urgently need, but time is not on our side.""

Biden and lawmakers have a series of crucial steps this summer and fall. The bulk of budget reconciliation will likely happen in September and October, teeing up the crucial United Nations Climate Change Conference where the US and other nations will meet to discuss decarbonization commitments.

As Biden's top international climate official, Kerry will have a crucial role to play in the coming international talks in Glasgow, Scotland later this fall. In a statement, Kerry said Glasgow ""must be a turning point in this crisis"" where all major economies commit to ""aggressive"" action on climate during the next decade. Kerry's comments were also echoed by Secretary of State Tony Blinken.

""We cannot delay ambitious climate action any longer,"" Blinken said in a statement. ""This moment requires world leaders, the private sector, and individuals to act together with urgency and do everything it takes to protect our planet and our future in this decade and beyond."""

47	47	"UN chief says the prediction of quicker onset of global warming tipping point ‘must sound a death knell’ for fossil fuels.

A UN climate report that predicts quicker global warming than anticipated just three years ago “must sound a death knell” for coal, oil and gas and is “code red” for humanity, according to the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded on Monday that drastic cuts to emissions are needed in order to hold the global temperature to under the 1.5C (2.7F) limits set by the 2015 Paris Agreement.

“Today’s IPCC Working Group 1 Report is a ‘code red’ for humanity,” Guterres said.

“The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable: Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk. Global heating is affecting every region on Earth, with many of the changes becoming irreversible.

“This report must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels before they destroy our planet.”

Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said the long-awaited report contained “no real surprises”.

“It confirms what we already know from thousands of previous studies and reports – we are in an emergency,” Thunberg said.

“It’s a solid summary of the current best available science.

The new IPCC report contains no real surprises. It confirms what we already know from thousands previous studies and reports – that we are in an emergency. It’s a solid (but cautious) summary of the current best available science. 1/2 — Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) August 9, 2021

“It doesn’t tell us what to do,” she noted of the report, which synthesises reams of climate studies conducted in recent years.

“It is up to us to be brave and take decisions based on the scientific evidence provided in these reports. We can still avoid the worst consequences, but not if we continue like today, and not without treating the crisis like a crisis.”

British PM Boris Johnson said the report should serve as “a wake-up call” for world leaders as they prepare to gather in Scotland later this year for the next summit on the climate crisis.

“Today’s report makes for sobering reading, and it is clear that the next decade is going to be pivotal to securing the future of our planet,” Johnson said in a statement.

“We know what must be done to limit global warming – consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the front line.”

World leaders will meet at the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November, in what is being described as the most important meeting on the crisis since the 2015 Paris summit.

“As the IPCC makes plain, the impacts of the climate crisis, from extreme heat to wildfires to intense rainfall and flooding, will only continue to intensify unless we choose another course for ourselves and generations to come,” said US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.

“What the world requires now is real action. All major economies must commit to aggressive climate action during this critical decade.”

Humanity can no longer delay “ambitious” climate action, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday after the release of the UN report.

“This moment requires world leaders, the private sector, and individuals to act together with urgency and do everything it takes to protect our planet,” Blinken said in a statement.

“We cannot delay ambitious climate action any longer,” he added.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the report “rightly emphasises, once again, the real urgency to take all the necessary measures to fully implement the Paris accord (on climate change), which is the compass for all of us”.

French Environment Minister Barbara Pompili said in a statement that “the challenge is immense because it involves emerging within a decade from a civilisation that has been based on fossil fuels for several centuries”."
