568	780	712	That chance rallied the Italian fans congregated behind Pickford's goal, who had fallen largely silent after their team's lackluster first half.	Incredibly, the midfielder who converted the decisive penalty in a shootout win over Spain in the semifinals also failed to score as Pickford tipped the effort off the post.	1	0	6	VDS
569	781	704	This was now without question Italy's best period of the match so far, for the first time its passing was starting to pull the English defense from one side to another to force some openings.	That was the only time Italy's famously robust defense was really opened up in the entire 120 minutes.	3	1	3	VDS
570	782	711	England soon retaliated, however, with John Stones rising highest in the area to head Trippier's corner towards goal and force Gianluigi Donnarumma to tip the ball over the crossbar.	After the misses of Rashford - he stuttered up to the ball and then hit the post - and Sancho, whose shot was saved by Donnarumma again down to his left, Jorginho had the chance to win it for Italy.	1	1	5	VDS
571	783	708	But Italy soon got the goal its improved performance deserved.	Italy's equalizer was merited and Bonucci was the unlikely scorer.	1	5	1	DS
572	784	709	Berardi's corner to the far post somehow found its way to Marco Verratti, who saw his shot saved excellently onto the post by Pickford, but Bonucci was in the right place at the right time to tap the rebound into an empty net.	He put the ball in from close range after a right-wing corner was flicked on to Marco Verratti, whose stooping header was tipped onto the post by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.	4	3	1	SS
573	785	688	Now it was the turn of the Italian fans to fill Wembley with noise, as England's supporters descended into a nervous silence with their team now on the back foot.	Then Italy's jubilant players headed to the other end of the field and ran as one, diving to the ground in front of the Italian fans who have witnessed a rebirth of their national team.	0	5	2	DS
574	786	686	The minor capitulation forced Gareth Southgate into making his first substitutions, as Saka and Henderson replaced Trippier and Declan Rice.	That was England's third straight failure from the penalty spot in the shootout, with Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho - players brought on late in extra time seemingly as specialist penalty-takers - also missing.	0	1	6	VDS
575	787	705	It so nearly went from bad to worse for England as Bonucci's raking long ball found Berardi bearing down on goal, but the forward could only send his volley over the crossbar.	Indeed, after Shaw's goal, England barely saw the ball for the rest of the game.	1	3	3	<\n>
576	788	705	England now seemed to be doubting everything that had helped them reach the final; Maguire, normally assured in defense, hacked a desperate clearance away under no pressure at all, while Kane's passes began falling short of their desired target.	Indeed, after Shaw's goal, England barely saw the ball for the rest of the game.	2	2	3	VDS

578	790	706	The game was on a knife edge as it entered the final 10 minutes, though Italian fans would certainly have been more confident than their English counterparts of snatching a win.	Italy's midfielders dominated possession, as widely predicted before the match, and England simply resorted to dropping deep and getting nine or even all 10 outfield players behind the ball.	0	5	2	DS
579	791	703	Extra time continued in much the same vein with neither side able to stamp its authority on proceedings, both perhaps too nervous to commit at this late stage.

580	792	686	Southgate threw on Rashford, 23, and Sancho, 21, for the penalty shootout but both men went on to miss as England suffered an all too familiar fate.

"We continue to believe it is likely that a third-dose booster may be needed within six to 12 months after full vaccination to maintain the highest level of protection, and studies are underway to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a third dose,"" Dolsten said, adding that data suggest antibody levels appear to decline around eight months after receiving a second dose of vaccine."	0	1	6	VDS

"We continue to believe it is likely that a third-dose booster may be needed within six to 12 months after full vaccination to maintain the highest level of protection, and studies are underway to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a third dose,"" Dolsten said, adding that data suggest antibody levels appear to decline around eight months after receiving a second dose of vaccine."	0	5	2	DS
833	1109	1062	If third shots are cleared for the general population, the boosters would likely represent a multi-billion-dollar business for Pfizer.	In order for third doses to be administered to people in the United States, the emergency use authorization that the FDA issued for the vaccine would either need to be amended or, if the vaccine were fully FDA approved, a third dose could be given off label.	1	1	5	VDS
834	1110	1053	In a study posted online but not yet peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal, Pfizer and BioNTech scientists reported that the vaccine had a sky-high efficacy rate of about 96 percent against symptomatic Covid-19 for the first two months following the second dose.	The data show that the vaccine's efficacy peaked at more than 96% from a week to around two months after receiving a second dose of vaccine, and then appeared to gradually decline to 83.7% four to six months later, with an average decline of about 6% over the last two months.	2	3	2	DS

840	1116	1058	The findings fit with what scientists have learned about how the immune system fends off viruses.	Also, there is much more to the immune system than antibodies.	0	4	3	DS
841	1117	1063	Antibodies are the only defense to prevent an infection, but their levels typically drop in the months after vaccination or recovery from the disease.

842	1118	1059	If the coronavirus takes hold, immune cells can swoop in to destroy infected cells and make new antibodies.	For instance, experts say it remains unclear how antibody levels correlate with real-world immunity, and to what extent other parts of the immune system -- such as B cells and T cells -- could factor into protection.	0	1	6	VDS
843	1119	1054	That enduring defense produced by the vaccine may explain how the virus can sometimes breed in the nose — producing a cold or sore throat — but fail to reach the lung where it can cause serious disease.	Earlier this month, Pfizer announced it has seen waning immunity from its coronavirus vaccine, saying it is picking up its efforts to develop a third dose that will protect people from variants.	0	2	5	VDS
