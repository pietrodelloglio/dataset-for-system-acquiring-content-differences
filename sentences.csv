31	31	32.0	0	The science team is already hard at work examining the rover's pictures and figuring out what to tackle first.
32	32	33.0	0	Glaze said she's eager to see the imaging and microphone data gathered by the rover during its descent.
33	33	34.0	0	For the first time, 'we're all going to get to experience just exactly what that was like,' she said.
34	34	35.0	0	It's tasked with using its suite of sophisticated cameras and specialized instruments to search for so-called biosignatures ' materials, textures and other telltale patterns in ancient rock that could be signs of past life.
35	35	36.0	0	The rover's job will be to select a promising and diverse set of samples, which it will collect and stow on the surface for future spacecraft to retrieve and ferry back to scientists waiting on Earth.
36	36	37.0	0	Advertisement Jezero Crater is an ideal spot for this work, geologists say.
37	37	38.0	0	It features a delta ' a clear sign that running water once flowed into a body of water like a lake.

68	68	18.0	1	Acting Administrator Steve Jurczyk congratulates the team on a successful CountdownToMars:
69	69	19.0	1	NASA scientists have described Perseverance as the most ambitious of nearly 20 US missions to Mars dating back to the Mariner spacecraft's 1965 fly-by.
70	70	20.0	1	Larger and packed with more instruments than the four Mars rovers preceding it, Perseverance is set to build on previous findings that liquid water once flowed on the Martian surface and that carbon and other minerals altered by water and considered precursors to the evolution of life were present.
71	71	21.0	1	Perseverance's payload also includes demonstration projects that could help pave the way for eventual human exploration of Mars, including a device to convert the carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere into pure oxygen.
72	72	22.0	1	The box-shaped tool, the first built to extract a natural resource of direct use to humans from an extraterrestrial environment, could prove invaluable for future human life support on Mars and for producing rocket propellant to fly astronauts home.
73	73	23.0	1	Another experimental prototype Perseverance carried is a miniature helicopter designed to test the first powered, controlled flight of an aircraft on another planet.
74	74	24.0	1	If successful, the 1.8-kg (four-pound) helicopter could lead to low-altitude aerial surveillance of distant worlds, officials said.
75	75	25.0	1	The daredevil nature of the rover's descent to the Martian surface, at a site that NASA described as both tantalising to scientists and especially hazardous for landing, was a momentous achievement in itself.

78	78	28.0	1	The multi-stage spacecraft carrying the rover soared into the top of Martian atmosphere at nearly 16 times the speed of sound on Earth, angled to produce aerodynamic lift while jet thrusters adjusted its trajectory.
79	79	29.0	1	A jarring, supersonic parachute inflation further slowed the descent, giving way to deployment of a rocket-powered 'sky crane' vehicle that flew to a safe landing spot, lowered the rover on tethers, then flew off to crash a safe distance away.
80	80	30.0	1	Perseverance's immediate predecessor, the rover Curiosity, landed in 2012 and remains in operation, as does the stationary lander InSight, which arrived in 2018 to study the deep interior of Mars.
81	81	31.0	1	Last week, separate probes launched by the United Arab Emirates and China reached Martian orbit.
82	82	1.0	2	NASA has unveiled the first pictures from its fifth Mars rover, Perseverance, after a successful landing on the red planet's Jezero crater at approximately 3:55 p.m. Thursday.
83	83	2.0	2	The Mars 2020 Perseverance mission embodies our nation's spirit of persevering even in the most challenging of situations, inspiring, and advancing science and exploration.
84	84	3.0	2	Perseverance, the most technologically advanced robot NASA has sent to date, traveled 293 million miles to reach Mars over the course of more than six months after launching on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Station on July 30.

88	88	7.0	2	The 2.7 billion rover, built in NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., is about 10 feet long, 9 feet wide, seven feet tall and about 2,260 pounds, roughly 278 pounds heavier than its predecessor, Curiosity.
89	89	8.0	2	Perserverance is designed to drive an average of 650 feet per Martian day and features seven scientific instruments, a robotic arm that reaches about seven feet long, a rock drill.
90	90	9.0	2	The scientific instruments on the rover include a camera designed to take high-definition video, panoramic color and 3D images of the Martian surface and features in the atmosphere with a zoom lens to magnify distant targets, a group of sensors to measure weather and monitor dust on the planet's surface, a system that will be used to produce oxygen from the Martian carbon-dioxide atmosphere, an x-ray and camera system that can measure the chemical makeup of rocks and analyze features as small as a grain of salt, a ground-penetrating radar system to analyze geologic features under Mars' surface, a group of cameras, spectrometers, and a laser to search for organics and minerals as well as take clse up images of rock grains and surface textures, and a camera to identify the chemical composition of rocks and soils, including their atomic and molecular makeup.

93	93	12.0	2	"The ""seven minutes of terror"" is referred to by NASA engineers as the time it takes to enter the Martian atmosphere and descend to the surface."
94	94	13.0	2	The spacecraft is guided solely by pre-programmed controls in its onboard computer, due to a roughly 11 minute signal delay between Earth and Mars.
95	95	14.0	2	Perseverance entered into the atmosphere at about 12,100 miles per hour in a protective capsule.
96	96	15.0	2	The spacecraft then deployed a parachute to begin slowing down before removing its protective capsule and heat shield.
97	97	16.0	2	The rover's landing mechanism then fired eight rocket thrusters to slow down from about 170 miles per hour to about two miles per hour and guide it to a proper landing spot before using a sky crane to lower onto Mars' surface.
98	98	17.0	2	Perseverance landed in the Jezero Crater, a 28-mile-wide basin in the northern hemisphere of Mars, where NASA believes a body of water about the size of Lake Tahoe used to flow.
99	99	18.0	2	The Perseverance science team believes this ancient river delta and lake deposits could have collected and preserved organic molecules and other potential signs of microbial life.
100	100	19.0	2	THE FOX NEWS APP Perseverance is also carrying the Ingenuity helicopter, a technology demonstration that will attempt the first powered, controlled flight on another planet.
101	101	20.0	2	Ingenuinity will be deployed in a few months from underneath the rover in a flat area.
102	102	21.0	2	Perseverance will then drive about 330 feet away to capture the flight attempt with its cameras.
103	103	22.0	2	Once Ingenuity's test flights are complete, the rover's search for evidence of ancient microbial life will begin.
104	104	23.0	2	Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with the European Space Agency, will send spacecraft to Mars to collect the cached samples recovered from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis.
105	105	1.0	3	After zipping hundreds of millions of miles through space, the Mars rover Perseverance is just minutes away from attempting to land on the red planet in what has been described as one of the most daring robotic maneuvers in NASA's history.
106	106	2.0	3	The car-size rover, which launched in July 2020, is aiming to touch down on Mars on Thursday at around 3:55 p.m. ET.
107	107	3.0	3	If successful, Perseverance will become NASA's fifth rover to land on the red planet and will kick off the agency's most ambitious mission yet to examine whether life ever existed on Mars. '
108	108	4.0	3	Perseverance is attempting to answer one of the biggest questions in the history of humanity: Is there life elsewhere in the solar system'' said Chris Carberry, co-founder and CEO of Explore Mars, a nonprofit organization that advocates for human exploration of the planet. '
109	109	5.0	3	If people can't get excited about this mission, I don't know what's wrong with them.'
110	110	6.0	3	Like its predecessor, Curiosity, the Perseverance rover's descent to the Martian surface has been dubbed the 'seven minutes of terror.'
111	111	7.0	3	This is because a complex sequence of programmed events must occur at precise times in order for the landing to be successful.
112	112	8.0	3	Once it enters Mars' atmosphere, the entire spacecraft is pretty much acting autonomously,' said Janet Ivey, president of Explore Mars. '
113	113	9.0	3	You can't send a message from Earth to divert it from landing on a hill or near a big rock.
114	114	10.0	3	Only around half of all previous attempts to land a spacecraft on Mars have succeeded, according to NASA, and Perseverance's planned touchdown is particularly risky.
115	115	11.0	3	Once the rover enters Mars' atmosphere, it will be traveling at roughly 12,000 miles per hour, according to NASA.
116	116	12.0	3	A parachute will then be deployed and shortly before touchdown a 'jetpack' will fire a series of retrorockets to slow the spacecraft.
117	117	13.0	3	An intricate sky-crane ' similar to the one used during the Curiosity rover's landing ' will then lower the rover to the Martian surface.
118	118	14.0	3	During the nerve-racking entry and descent phase, friction from Mars' atmosphere will also subject the spacecraft to temperatures of more than 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit, mission managers have said.
119	119	15.0	3	The rover is aiming to settle in Jezero Crater, a 28-mile-wide basin just north of the Martian equator that scientists think was once home to an ancient river delta.
120	120	16.0	3	If Mars once supported life billions of years ago, it's thought that Jezero Crater could be the best place to look for potential fossilized clues in the region's sediments and mineral deposits.
121	121	17.0	3	But Jezero's landscape is also characterized by large boulder fields, sand dunes and cliffs that make a landing unpredictable and challenging. '
122	122	18.0	3	No Mars landing is guaranteed, but we have been preparing a decade to put this rover's wheels down on the surface of Mars and get to work,' Jennifer Trosper, deputy project manager for the Perseverance mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a statement.
123	123	19.0	3	If successful, the Perseverance mission could be the start of a new era of Mars exploration, according to Robert Zubrin, author of 'The Case for Mars' and founder of The Mars Society, a nonprofit organization that aims to advance human missions to the red planet. '
124	124	20.0	3	Perseverance could conceivably find fossilized microbial life,' Zubrin said. '
125	125	21.0	3	If we could drill, find these microfossils, bring them up and subject them to all kinds of examination, we would find out the truth about life in the universe.
126	126	22.0	3	The mission will also lay the groundwork for future human missions to the red planet.
127	127	23.0	3	The rover is outfitted with a suite of seven tools to study the planet's geology and past climate.
128	128	24.0	3	In addition to high-powered cameras, Perseverance is equipped with a drill and robotic arm to collect samples, an instrument to examine the chemical composition of rocks and sediments, a tool to measure weather on Mars and an experiment to test if oxygen can be produced from Mars' carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere.
129	129	25.0	3	The rover is also carrying a helicopter, known as Ingenuity, that mission controllers will use to attempt the first controlled flights on another planet.
130	130	26.0	3	The 4-pound drone is designed to fly around and scout out nearby areas in and around Jezero Crater.
131	131	27.0	3	The Perseverance mission is part of a broader NASA initiative with the European Space Agency that aims to collect samples of rocks and sediment from Mars and return them to Earth.
132	132	28.0	3	Earlier this month, separate space probes from the United Arab Emirates and China successfully entered into orbit around Mars, making them just the fifth and sixth nations to do so.

145	145	13.0	4	What makes this rover different from the others that have gone before it'
146	146	14.0	4	The rover has a personality, a drive to succeed that informs its choices.
147	147	15.0	4	Rivera, a digital and social media specialist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who on Thursday monitored Perseverance's Facebook account, said the character-creation processes included deep thoughts about things like the rover's hobbies.
148	148	16.0	4	According to Twitter, those hobbies are photography, collecting rocks and off-roading.
149	149	17.0	4	"For the past few years, we've lived with the mission team,"" said Mart'nez, manager for Mars public engagement."
150	150	18.0	4	That personality sort of becomes self-evident and very recognizable to us as we work closely with the mission team.
151	151	19.0	4	Being there every day, we see how different it is from the other robots.
152	152	20.0	4	And the team behind Perseverance's social media presence isn't shy about comparisons to past projects.

585	585	1.0	21	A Chinese spacecraft descended through the thin Martian atmosphere and landed safely on a large plain on Saturday morning, state media reported, accomplishing a feat that only two other nations had before.
586	586	2.0	21	(In the United States, it was still Friday — 7:18 p.m. Eastern time — when the spacecraft touched down.)
587	587	3.0	21	The landing follows China’s launch last month of the core module of a new orbiting space station, as well as a successful mission in December that collected nearly four pounds of rocks and soil from the moon and brought it to Earth.
588	588	4.0	21	Next month, the country plans to send three astronauts into space, inaugurating what could become a regular Chinese presence in Earth’s orbit.
589	589	5.0	21	Just by arriving at Mars and orbiting it in February, China’s space program confirmed its place among the top tier of agencies exploring the solar system.
590	590	6.0	21	Now that it has executed a landing — with the deployment of a rover still to come — it has established itself as a principal contender in what some view as a new era of space competition.
591	591	1.0	22	After several months orbiting Mars, a Chinese rover successfully touched down on the Martian surface Friday, making China the second nation, after the United States, to achieve a soft landing on the red planet.
592	592	2.0	22	The rover, named Zhurong after the Chinese god of fire, is part of China's Tianwen-1 mission, which launched in July 2020.
593	593	3.0	22	The landing is a major milestone for China's space agency, which has advanced rapidly in just a few decades.
594	594	4.0	22	Few details about the Tianwen-1 mission have been made public, but the Mars probe and its accompanying rover are designed to map the Martian surface and search for signs of life on the planet.

596	596	6.0	22	Y-4 rocket takes off from Wenchang Space Launch Center in Wenchang, China July 23, 2020.
597	597	7.0	22	"The China National Space Administration said in a statement Friday that the Tianwen-1 spacecraft ""has functioned normally"" since it's launch last year and has collected a ""huge amount of scientific data."
598	598	8.0	22	The Zhurong rover landed Friday shortly after 7 p.m. ET in a region of Mars known as Utopia Planitia.
599	599	9.0	22	The vast, icy plain was also where NASA's now-defunct Viking 2 lander touched down in 1976.
600	600	10.0	22	Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, congratulated China's space agency shortly after the landing was confirmed.
601	601	11.0	22	"Together with the global science community, I look forward to the important contributions this mission will make to humanity's understanding of the Red Planet,"" he wrote on Twitter."
602	602	12.0	22	China's Tianwen-1 mission is a key part of the country's lofty ambitions for space exploration.
603	603	13.0	22	In December 2020, a Chinese probe landed on the moon and subsequently returned to Earth with a cache of lunar samples.
604	604	14.0	22	As a result, China became only the third country, after the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, to accomplish such a feat.
605	605	15.0	22	In late April, China launched into orbit the first module for a planned space station.
606	606	16.0	22	Rocket debris from that launch later fell back to Earth, crashing into the Indian Ocean and drawing criticism from NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and others over China's handling of the incident.
607	607	17.0	22	In addition to China's Zhurong rover, the red planet is playing host to several other new spacecraft.
608	608	18.0	22	NASA's Perseverance rover successfully touched down on the Martian surface on Feb. 18 and officially began collecting science data this week.
609	609	19.0	22	Previously, the rover served as a communications base for a tiny experimental helicopter, dubbed Ingenuity, which conducted the first powered, controlled flights on another planet.
610	610	20.0	22	In February, the United Arab Emirates' Hope probe also entered into orbit around Mars, making the UAE only the fifth nation or entity to do so.
611	611	1.0	23	China's Zhurong Mars rover, mounted atop a rocket-powered lander, dropped away from its orbiting Tianwen-1 mothership Friday and descended to touchdown on the red planet, official news agencies confirmed, a superpower feat that highlights the growing prowess of the Chinese space program.
612	612	2.0	23	The China National Space Administration confirmed Zhurong, named after the god of fire in Chinese mythology, landed on a broad plain known as Utopia Planitia Friday at 7:18 p.m. EDT (7:18
613	613	3.0	23	a.m. Saturday Beijing time) after a fiery plunge through the thin martian atmosphere.
614	614	4.0	23	"Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's director of space science at NASA Headquarters, congratulated China on the successful landing, tweeting, ""together with the global science community"
615	615	5.0	23	, I look forward to the important contributions this mission will make to humanity's understanding of the Red Planet.
616	616	6.0	23	Like NASA's Perseverance rover before it, Zhurong relied on a heat shield and protective aeroshell to protect it from the extreme temperatures generated after hitting the atmosphere at nearly three miles per second.
617	617	7.0	23	Once through the plasma heating zone, a large parachute presumably unfurled as planned, dramatically slowing the craft to sub-sonic velocities.

619	619	9.0	23	Finally, about seven minutes after hitting the atmosphere, the lander was programmed to fall free of its parachute, firing small rocket engines for a powered descent to the surface.
620	620	10.0	23	After extensive tests and checkout — China has not revealed the rover's schedule — two ramps will unfurl, allowing the six-wheel rover to roll off the lander's upper deck and down onto the surface for at least three months of robotic exploration.
621	621	11.0	23	"Tianwen-1 is going to orbit, land and release a rover all on the very first try,"" mission managers wrote before launch in the journal Nature Astronomy."
622	622	12.0	23	The Tianwen-1 orbiter and Zhurong lander arrived in orbit around Mars on February 10, seven months after launch from Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on Hainan Island in the South China Sea.
623	623	13.0	23	Eight days later, NASA's 2.4 billion Perseverance rover successfully landed in Jezero crater on the edge of Utopia Planitia.
624	624	14.0	23	The nuclear-powered Perseverance is NASA's ninth and most technologically advanced Mars lander to successfully reach the surface, carrying a suite of sophisticated cameras, spectrometers and other instruments designed to search for signs of past microbial life.
625	625	15.0	23	It also carries a complex sample caching mechanism to collect rock and soil samples for eventual return to Earth and deployed a small helicopter — Ingenuity — that has carried out five successful test flights to date.
626	626	16.0	23	Tianwen-1 is the first all-Chinese mission to the red planet and its most sophisticated interplanetary probe to date.
627	627	17.0	23	While not in the same league with Perseverance, the combination of a powerful orbiter and surface rover for China's first attempt at Mars is a harbinger of more ambitious missions to come.
628	628	18.0	23	NASA's record stands at nine successful landings in 10 attempts while Russia endured eight lander failures with just one partial success.
629	629	19.0	23	The Tianwen-1 mother ship, which will remain in orbit around the martian poles throughout its two-year mission, is equipped with seven instruments, including high- and medium-resolution cameras; a ground-penetrating radar; a mineralogy spectrometer; a magnetometer; and two charged particle detectors.
630	630	20.0	23	As with Perseverance, Chinese flight controllers will not be able to operate the Zhurong rover in realtime.
631	631	21.0	23	Instead, flight controllers will uplink commands for the rover and then await the results, relayed back to Earth through the Tianwen-1 orbiter.
632	632	22.0	23	China has successfully sent two rovers to the moon, including one that landed on the never-before-visited far side.
633	633	23.0	23	An attempt to send an orbiter to Mars atop a Russian rocket in 2011 ended in failure when the Zenit booster malfunctioned.
634	634	1.0	24	Video Player Close BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China on Saturday landed its Mars probe, Tianwen-1, on the red planet, ushering in a new chapter of China's deep space exploration and marking another contribution to humanity's exploration of the universe.

636	636	3.0	24	The successful landing of Tianwen-1 in Utopia Planitia is a stepping stone to answering questions and future missions.
637	637	4.0	24	Like the space station project and lunar exploration program, China is pursuing the deep space quest for a better shared future, in addition to proving its space capacity.
638	638	5.0	24	And China is not looking to compete for leadership in space.
639	639	6.0	24	China embarked on the journey to stay true to its original target -- unveiling the secrets of the universe and contributing to humanity's peaceful use of space.
640	640	7.0	24	It could help humanity go deeper into space and provide first-hand data for research, such as the origin and evolution of the solar system and life.
641	641	8.0	24	It can be reached using existing space capabilities, and its environment is closest to Earth in the solar system.
642	642	9.0	24	The independent mission endured a near seven-month journey plus the final intense moments of entry, descent and landing.
643	643	10.0	24	A relatively flat region in the southern part of the Utopia Planitia was chosen for the landing and scientific research value.
644	644	11.0	24	Earlier research showed the landing site might be the edge of an ancient ocean or lake in the early history of Mars.
645	645	12.0	24	Chinese scientists are looking for more evidence of water-ice, and will share the data with their international counterparts.
646	646	13.0	24	In its maiden voyage, it took a 3-in-1 approach (orbiting, landing, and roving in one mission), an innovative but complex way, hoping to push technological boundaries and test more options in deep space exploration.
647	647	14.0	24	The rover is named after the god of fire in ancient Chinese mythology.
648	648	15.0	24	Zhu, meaning wish, expresses the good wishes for humankind's space exploration.
649	649	16.0	24	Rong, meaning integration and cooperation, reflects China's vision of the peaceful use of space and building a community with a shared future for humanity.
650	650	17.0	24	On board Zhurong, six types of scientific payloads are designed to unlock more secrets of the red planet.
651	651	18.0	24	China will cooperate, contribute and share, expanding knowledge about our planetary neighbor and beyond.
652	652	1.0	25	An uncrewed Chinese spacecraft successfully landed on the surface of Mars on Saturday, state news agency Xinhua reported, making China the second space-faring nation after the United States to land on the Red Planet.
653	653	2.0	25	The Tianwen-1 spacecraft landed on a site on a vast plain known as Utopia Planitia, “leaving a Chinese footprint on Mars for the first time”, Xinhua said.
654	654	3.0	25	The landing module separated from the orbiter three hours later and entered the Martian atmosphere, the official China Space News said.
655	655	4.0	25	It said the landing process consisted of “nine minutes of terror” as the module decelerates and then slowly descends.
656	656	5.0	25	A solar-powered rover, named Zhurong, will now survey the landing site before departing from its platform to conduct inspections.
657	657	6.0	25	Named after a mythical Chinese god of fire, Zhurong has six scientific instruments including a high-resolution topography camera.
658	658	7.0	25	Zhurong will also look for signs of ancient life, including any sub-surface water and ice, using ground-penetrating radar.

690	690	13.0	27	Now, they are the best team in Europe and on a national-record 34-match unbeaten run under Roberto Mancini, their suave coach who has won an international trophy in his first attempt to add to the country's other European title â€” in 1968 â€” and its four World Cups.
691	691	14.0	27	Mancini joined his players on the podium as Italy captain Giorgio Chiellini lifted the Henri Delaunay trophy to the backdrop of fireworks and tickertape.
692	692	15.0	27	"It was impossible even to just consider this at one stage,"" Mancini said, ""but the guys were just amazing."
693	693	16.0	27	For England, it's the latest heartache in shootouts at major tournaments, after defeats in 1990, 1996, 1998, 2004, 2006 and 2012.
694	694	17.0	27	They ended that losing streak by beating Colombia on penalties in the round of 16 at the 2018 World Cup, but the pain has quickly returned.
695	695	18.0	27	"The boys couldn't have given more,"" England captain Harry Kane said."
696	696	19.0	27	Penalties are the worst feeling in the world when you lose.
697	697	20.0	27	It's been a fantastic tournament â€” we should be proud, hold our heads up high.
698	698	21.0	27	"It's going to hurt now, it's going to hurt for a while."""
699	699	22.0	27	Bukayo Saka of England is consoled by teammates Luke Shaw, Kalvin Phillips and Mason Mount following the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship Final between Italy and England at Wembley Stadium on July 11, 2021 in London, England.
700	700	23.0	27	England's first major final in 55 years had all started so well, too, with Luke Shaw scoring the fastest goal in a European Championship final by meeting a cross from opposite wing back
701	701	24.0	27	Kieran Trippier with a half-volley that went in off the post in the second minute.
702	702	25.0	27	It was Shaw's first goal for England and it prompted a fist-pump between David Beckham and Tom Cruise in the VIP box amid an explosion of joy around Wembley, which had at least 67,000 fans inside.
703	703	26.0	27	Maybe more, given dozens of ticketless England fans managed to barge their way past stewards and police and into the stadium in unsettling scenes before kickoff.
704	704	27.0	27	That was the only time Italy's famously robust defense was really opened up in the entire 120 minutes.
705	705	28.0	27	Indeed, after Shaw's goal, England barely saw the ball for the rest of the game.
706	706	29.0	27	Italy's midfielders dominated possession, as widely predicted before the match, and England simply resorted to dropping deep and getting nine or even all 10 outfield players behind the ball.
707	707	30.0	27	It was reminiscent of the 2018 World Cup semifinals, when England also scored early against Croatia then spent most of the game chasing its opponent's midfield before losing in extra time.
708	708	31.0	27	Italy's equalizer was merited and Bonucci was the unlikely scorer.
709	709	32.0	27	He put the ball in from close range after a right-wing corner was flicked on to Marco Verratti, whose stooping header was tipped onto the post by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.
710	710	33.0	27	England managed to hold on for extra time â€” the way three of the last six European finals went â€” and actually had the better of the final stages.
711	711	34.0	27	After the misses of Rashford â€” he stuttered up to the ball and then hit the post â€” and Sancho, whose shot was saved by Donnarumma again down to his left, Jorginho had the chance to win it for Italy.
712	712	35.0	27	Incredibly, the midfielder who converted the decisive penalty in a shootout win over Spain in the semifinals also failed to score as Pickford tipped the effort off the post.
713	713	36.0	27	It was Donnarumma who then made the crucial saves and within minutes he had also been named player of the tournament, the first goalkeeper to be so honored.
714	714	37.0	27	Italy players celebrate with goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma after he saved the last penalty shoot-out following the UEFA Euro 2020 Final at Wembley Stadium, London.
715	715	38.0	27	So instead of coming home, the trophy is headed to Rome.
716	716	39.0	27	We'd heard it day in, day out from Wednesday night â€”
717	717	40.0	27	"we heard it would be coming home to London,"" Bonucci said."
718	718	41.0	27	I'm sorry for them, but the cup will be taking a nice flight, making its way to Rome
719	719	1.0	28	On a night fraught with tension, Italy clinched its first major title for 15 years with a penalty shootout win over England in the Euro 2020 final.
720	720	2.0	28	Luke Shaw's goal inside the opening two minutes gave England a lead it looked like it would hold onto all night, before a goalmouth scramble midway through the second half allowed Leonardo Bonucci to poke home an equalizer for Italy.
721	721	3.0	28	For the remainder of the match it felt as though extra-time and penalties were inevitable, as neither side seemed willing or brave enough to commit enough men forward to really trouble the opposing defenders.
722	722	4.0	28	England had suffered innumerable heartbreaks on penalties over the years and this time it was Italy's turn to inflict yet more pain on beleaguered English fans as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka all missed from the spot.
723	723	5.0	28	"During the wild Italian celebrations, Bonucci -- who had been immense all night and rightly earned the man of the match award -- screamed ""it's coming to Rome"" into the pitch side camera to rub yet more salt into the wounds of English fans."
724	724	6.0	28	England's wait to end its wretched run in major international competitions, stretching all the way back to 1966, will go for at least another year until the World Cup is hosted in Qatar.
725	725	7.0	28	Few would have expected Italy, which failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, to reach the final prior to the start of Euro 2020, much less win the entire competition, but Roberto Mancini's side quickly established itself as one of the contenders after three thrilling group stage performances.
726	726	8.0	28	Gianluigi Donnarumma, Italy's hero in the penalty shootout with two fine saves, was deservedly named the player of the tournament and
727	727	9.0	28	the goalkeeper heads up a group of talented stars that should ensure this side remains competitive for the foreseeable future.
728	728	10.0	28	As for England, this defeat is likely to sting for quite some time to come for players and fans alike, but the squad at least has the consolation of knowing it has provided the country with a tournament run not seen for more than five decades.
729	729	11.0	28	Wembley Way, the famous road leading up to England's national stadium, was heaving as many as seven hours before kick off.
730	730	12.0	28	Many of the fans here in the early afternoon didn't even have tickets, instead choosing to just soak up the atmosphere before moving on to watch the match elsewhere.
731	731	13.0	28	The fridges that stocked beer in one of the grocery stores closest to Wembley Stadium were almost completely empty by late morning.
732	732	14.0	28	For the vast majority of fans in attendance, this was something they had never experienced in their lifetimes.
733	733	15.0	28	It had been 55 long years since England was last in a major international final and fans have known only heartache and disappointment since that World Cup triumph in 1966.
734	734	16.0	28	"One couple considered it such a momentous occasion that they decided to get married on Wembley Way just hours before kick off, both dressed in full wedding attire and holding up England shirts with ""Mr"" and"
735	735	17.0	28	Even when cheering on 'golden generations' of the past, England fans have never supported their national team with a fervor quite like this.
736	736	18.0	28	Southgate and this group of players deserve much of the credit for stirring up such a feeling of national pride.
737	737	19.0	28	Fans provided an electric atmosphere inside Wembley before kick off.
738	738	20.0	28	Stars have regularly used their platform to speak out on social issues and, when it comes to Rashford's fight against child food poverty, have even managed to reverse government policy.
739	739	21.0	28	"I think we've got good players and ice boys, but more importantly relatable boys,"" English journalist Darren Lewis tells CNN."
740	740	22.0	28	I think the secret to the success of this team is that the people in charge of the England team --
741	741	23.0	28	and I mean the PR team around them -- have allowed them to speak on issues that affect them, on issues that people can connect with.
742	742	24.0	28	I remember being at the 2010 World Cup and England were keeping their players away from everyone, treating them like rock stars.
743	743	25.0	28	I remember going down to the harbor in South Africa and the Dutch were walking around -- they were finalists that year -- walking around, talking to people, just enjoying themselves.
744	744	26.0	28	I think this regime who are looking after the team, they realize that it's important just to let the players be players, let them be men who people can connect with.
745	745	27.0	28	If you walk through some parts of the crowd, I remember doing it after games and being struck by the diversity in the crowd; black, brown, white.
746	746	28.0	28	Everyone wants to be a part of this England because they identify with [Raheem] Sterling, [Harry] Kane, [Tyrone] Mings, [Jordan] Henderson.
747	747	29.0	28	They identify with these players because these players aren't detached.
748	748	30.0	28	They care about the people in the places that they come from and that means a lot to the general public.
749	749	31.0	28	However, that feeling of goodwill towards the national team seems to extend no further than England's borders.
750	750	32.0	28	Ahead of the final, viral memes have shown a map of Europe covered in Italian flags to signify the support of every other country on the continent.
751	751	33.0	28	"Much of the animosity towards England and its fans seems to have stemmed from the chant of ""football's coming home,"" the chorus of the 1996 song 'Three Lions' which has become the national team's adopted anthem."
752	752	34.0	28	The song was released ahead of Euro 96, hosted in England, and is about pessimism and despair, but still feeling hope that the national team may finally end years of heartache.
753	753	35.0	28	However, fans of rival countries have interpreted the chant as arrogant and presumptuous, despite multiple attempts to explain its true meaning.
754	754	36.0	28	"It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming' that's banging [on] since the beginning,"" Italian journalist Tancredi Palmeri told CNN."
755	755	37.0	28	At the beginning it was nice, but then it sounds like: '
756	756	38.0	28	You owe us,' like 'it belongs to us, so you owe us'
757	757	39.0	28	Just look at the footage of people singing all the time 'It's coming home' for a month.
758	758	40.0	28	It doesn't really look like, 'we are being ironic, being sarcastic.'
759	759	41.0	28	It looks like, 'finally we are getting back what is ours.'
760	760	42.0	28	Some fans outside the stadium certainly didn't endear themselves to the watching world when they broke through the security barriers in an attempt to get into Wembley before the gates had been opened.
761	761	43.0	28	In the hour leading up to kick off, Wembley was thundering.
762	762	44.0	28	Large swathes of English and Italian fans were mingling throughout the stadium, joining in chorus to belt out a number of songs that have become English anthems during Euro 2020.
763	763	45.0	28	By the time the national anthems came around, neither of which were booed by opposition fans, Wembley felt as though its very foundations were rocking.
764	764	46.0	28	When Shaw scored, then, with less than two minutes on the clock, the 60,000 or so fans inside the stadium raised the decibels to levels
765	765	47.0	28	Luke Shaw connects with Kieran Trippier's cross to open the scoring.
766	766	48.0	28	It was a wonderful move, too, with Shaw getting on the end of Kieran Trippier's deep cross to the far post to finish off a rapid counterattack.
767	767	49.0	28	England certainly hasn't thrilled with attacking football at this European Championships, instead its success has been built on an organized defense -- the best in the tournament -- and a smothering midfield.
768	768	50.0	28	However, the players perhaps sensed this was an occasion like no other and put Italy on the back foot from the first whistle.
769	769	51.0	28	Throughout Euro 2020, this Italian team has somewhat torn up the defensive blueprints that the country's national team has become synonymous with over the years.
770	770	52.0	28	Though it still boasts tremendous defensive leadership and organization in veteran central pairing Bonucci and Gorgio Chiellini, it's been the more fluid and aggressive attacking style that has caught the eye.
771	771	53.0	28	In the first 25 minutes of this contest, however, they had been stifled entirely by an England team that wasn't affording them a moment's rest on the ball.
772	772	54.0	28	On the rare occasion Italy did enjoy any extended period of possession, boos rang loudly around the stadium and when a foray forward was ended by a wayward pass, England's fans erupted into rapturous cheers.
773	773	55.0	28	Italy was still showing brief flashes of the exciting football that had got it this far -- notably through the quick-footed Lorenzo Insigne -- but its players were quickly met with a solid white wall whenever they threatened to fashion a sight of goal.
774	774	56.0	28	Mancini's side did create one opening before the half was over through Federico Chiesa, the goal hero from Italy's semifinal win over Spain, who picked up the ball from deep and drove towards the box, but could only drag his shot wide of Jordan Pickford's post.
775	775	57.0	28	Before the roar that greeted the referee's half time whistle, for the first time all evening Wembley had quietened down significantly; the first half had gone as perfectly as these fans could have dreamed of, perhaps they were already nervously allowing themselves to believe.
776	776	58.0	28	Italy rallies Less than five minutes into the second half, however, Insigne fired a direct free-kick not too far wide of Pickford's post just as a prompt reminder that this match was far from over.
777	777	59.0	28	With Italy still struggling to create anything from open play, Mancini was forced into making a double substitution after only 50 minutes, bringing on Bryan Cristante and Domenico Berardi for Nicolo Barella the ineffective Ciro Immobile.
778	778	60.0	28	The changes had almost the immediate desired impact, as Italy for the first time got in behind England's back line but Insigne's
779	779	61.0	28	shot from a narrow angle was well blocked by Pickford.
780	780	62.0	28	That chance rallied the Italian fans congregated behind Pickford's goal, who had fallen largely silent after their team's lackluster first half.
781	781	63.0	28	This was now without question Italy's best period of the match so far, for the first time its passing was starting to pull the English defense from one side to another to force some openings.
782	782	64.0	28	England soon retaliated, however, with John Stones rising highest in the area to head Trippier's corner towards goal and force Gianluigi Donnarumma to tip the ball over the crossbar.
783	783	65.0	28	But Italy soon got the goal its improved performance deserved.
784	784	66.0	28	Berardi's corner to the far post somehow found its way to Marco Verratti, who saw his shot saved excellently onto the post by Pickford, but Bonucci was in the right place at the right time to tap the rebound into an empty net.
785	785	67.0	28	Now it was the turn of the Italian fans to fill Wembley with noise, as England's supporters descended into a nervous silence with their team now on the back foot.
786	786	68.0	28	The minor capitulation forced Gareth Southgate into making his first substitutions, as Saka and Henderson replaced Trippier and Declan Rice.
787	787	69.0	28	It so nearly went from bad to worse for England as Bonucci's raking long ball found Berardi bearing down on goal, but the forward could only send his volley over the crossbar.
788	788	70.0	28	England now seemed to be doubting everything that had helped them reach the final; Maguire, normally assured in defense, hacked a desperate clearance away under no pressure at all, while Kane's passes began falling short of their desired target.
789	789	71.0	28	It was almost as if, for the first time all tournament, the magnitude of the occasion had finally started to dawn on these England players.
790	790	72.0	28	The game was on a knife edge as it entered the final 10 minutes, though Italian fans would certainly have been more confident than their English counterparts of snatching a win.
791	791	73.0	28	Extra time continued in much the same vein with neither side able to stamp its authority on proceedings, both perhaps too nervous to commit at this late stage.
792	792	74.0	28	Southgate threw on Rashford, 23, and Sancho, 21, for the penalty shootout but both men went on to miss as England suffered an all too familiar fate.

825	825	1.0	30	Italy defeats England in UEFA Euro 2020 final in penalty kick shootout LONDON (AP) - Italian soccer's redemption story is complete.
826	826	2.0	30	England's painful half-century wait for a major title goes on.
827	827	3.0	30	And it just had to be because of a penalty shootout.
828	828	4.0	30	Italy won the European Championship for the second time by beating England 3-2 on penalties on Sunday.
829	829	5.0	30	The match finished 1-1 after extra time at Wembley Stadium, which was filled mostly with English fans hoping to celebrate the team's first international trophy since the 1966 World Cup.
830	830	6.0	30	It's coming to Rome, Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci shouted into a TV camera amid the celebrations, mocking the famous lyric it's coming home from the England team's anthem.
831	831	7.0	30	For England, it was utter dejection again - they know the feeling so well
832	832	8.0	30	when it comes to penalties - after Gianluigi Donnarumma, Italy's imposing goalkeeper, dived to his left and saved the decisive spot kick by 19-year-old Londoner Bukayo Saka, one of the youngest players in England's squad.
833	833	9.0	30	That was England's third straight failure from the penalty spot in the shootout, with Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho - players brought on late in extra time seemingly as specialist penalty-takers - also missing.
834	834	10.0	30	As Saka and Sancho cried, Donnarumma was mobbed by his teammates as they sprinted toward him from the halfway line at the end of the second penalty shootout in a European Championship final.
835	835	11.0	30	Then Italy's jubilant players headed to the other end of the field and ran as one, diving to the ground in front of the Italian fans who have witnessed a rebirth of their national team.
836	836	12.0	30	It was less than four years ago that Italy plunged to the lowest moment of its soccer history by failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in six decades.
837	837	13.0	30	Now, they are the best team in Europe and on a national-record 34-match unbeaten run under Roberto Mancini, their suave coach who has won an international trophy in his first attempt to add to the country's other European title - in 1968 - and its four World Cups.

848	848	24.0	30	It was Shaw's first goal for England and it prompted a fist-pump between David Beckham and Tom Cruise in the VIP box amid an explosion of joy around Wembley, which had at least 67,000 fans inside.
849	849	25.0	30	Maybe more, given dozens of ticketless England fans managed to barge their way past stewards and police and into the stadium in unsettling scenes before kickoff.
850	850	26.0	30	That was the only time Italy's famously robust defense was really opened up in the entire 120 minutes.
851	851	27.0	30	Indeed, after Shaw's goal, England barely saw the ball for the rest of the game.
852	852	28.0	30	Italy's midfielders dominated possession, as widely predicted before the match, and England simply resorted to dropping deep and getting nine or even all 10 outfield players behind the ball.
853	853	29.0	30	It was reminiscent of the 2018 World Cup semifinals, when England also scored early against Croatia then spent most of the game chasing its opponent's midfield before losing in extra time.
854	854	30.0	30	Italy's equalizer was merited and Bonucci was the unlikely scorer.
855	855	31.0	30	He put the ball in from close range after a right-wing corner was flicked on to Marco Verratti, whose stooping header was tipped onto the post by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.
856	856	32.0	30	England managed to hold on for extra time - the way three of the last six European finals went - and actually had the better of the final stages.
857	857	33.0	30	After the misses of Rashford - he stuttered up to the ball and then hit the post - and Sancho, whose shot was saved by Donnarumma again down to his left, Jorginho had the chance to win it for Italy.
858	858	34.0	30	Incredibly, the midfielder who converted the decisive penalty in a shootout win over Spain in the semifinals also failed to score as Pickford tipped the effort off the post.
859	859	35.0	30	It was Donnarumma who then made the crucial saves and within minutes he had also been named player of the tournament, the first goalkeeper to be so honored.
860	860	36.0	30	So instead of coming home, the trophy is headed to Rome.
861	861	37.0	30	We'd heard it day in, day out from Wednesday night - we heard it would be coming home to London, Bonucci said.
862	862	38.0	30	I'm sorry for them, but the cup will be taking a nice flight, making its way to Rome
863	863	1.0	31	England's bid to end their 55-year wait for a major trophy ended in the familiar agony of defeat in a penalty shootout as Italy claimed the Euro 2020 crown at Wembley.
864	864	2.0	31	On a night of anticipation, tension and ultimate heartbreak in a feverish atmosphere, England looked on course for their most joyous day since 30 July 1966 when Luke Shaw gave them the perfect start after two minutes.
865	865	3.0	31	Italy, unbeaten in 33 matches before this final, slowly edged their way back into the game and were level in the 67th minute when Leonardo Bonucci pounced after England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford turned Marco Verratti's header on to a post.
866	866	4.0	31	And after a tense period of extra time failed to find a winner
867	867	5.0	31	, it was on to penalties and bitter disappointment for England manager Gareth Southgate and his players, who had gone into this final on a wave of expectation and high emotion.
868	868	6.0	31	England missed three of their five penalties, Marcus Rashford hitting a post and Gianluigi Donnarumma denying Jadon Sancho before - so cruelly for such a fine young player - Arsenal teenager Bukayo Saka also saw the giant Italy goalkeeper save his spot-kick.
869	869	7.0	31	Harry Kane and Harry Maguire scored for England but, while Pickford kept hopes alive with saves from Andrea Belotti and Jorginho, Domenico Berardi, Bonucci and Federico Bernardeschi scored for Italy.
870	870	8.0	31	The tearful 19-year-old Saka, who showed such courage to step forward, was consoled by his team-mates and manager, but there was no real consolation for them or the expectant fans packed into Wembley.
871	871	9.0	31	England's years of hurt go on but it looked for the first 30 minutes of this final that the moment the country has waited more than 20,000 days for had finally arrived.
872	872	10.0	31	Southgate's side came firing out of the blocks and the manager's one change - replacing Saka with Kieran Trippier - paid an instant dividend as Trippier ran on to Kane's perfect pass to find the onrushing Shaw at the far post
873	873	11.0	31	England were up and running and urged on by a vast, frenzied crowd they had this talented, streetwise Italian side on the back foot until they suddenly gained a foothold in the closing phase of the first half.
874	874	12.0	31	Italy dominated possession, and it was no surprise when they restored parity, then looking the more likely winners as Southgate's side, so full of running early on, started to labour, particularly after losing the outstanding Declan Rice to a knock.
875	875	13.0	31	Southgate surprisingly waited until extra time to introduce Jack Grealish but by that stage the game was locked on course for penalties
876	876	14.0	31	Sancho and Rashford came on in the closing moments, presumably in readiness for penalties, but sadly for Southgate, who has got so much right in Euro 2020, this was one move that did not pay off as both failed with their spot-kicks.
877	877	15.0	31	Pickford performed heroics to save two penalties but he was also left in tears after England's fate was sealed.
878	878	16.0	31	Italy edged over the line and both Southgate and his players looked devastated as they took sympathetic applause from England's fans, who had arrived with such high hopes but filed out of Wembley with their dreams of a major trophy shattered once more.
879	879	17.0	31	England came close when they reached the semi-final of the World Cup in Moscow in 2018 but this loss will cut even deeper after they made such smooth progress to the final and had the chance to finally claim a second trophy in what was effectively a home tournament with its climax at Wembley.
880	880	18.0	31	They have made progress - but still England could not clear the final hurdle.
881	881	19.0	31	Improving England offer real hope Southgate has led England to a World Cup semi-final and now a European Championship final in the last two tournaments England's loss will be felt deeply after such impressive progress through the knockout stage with wins against Germany, Ukraine and Denmark.
882	882	20.0	31	Southgate must now digest whether he got it right in the final when it came to his approach, substitutions and penalty-takers but when the dust settles England can reflect on progress made.
883	883	21.0	31	England took one step further than they did in Russia and Southgate now has a potent blend of youth and experience to work with as he plots a course to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
884	884	22.0	31	Saka came of age in this tournament while England have exciting young in the shape of Sancho, Phil Foden, Mason Mount and Jude Bellingham, augmented by Grealish.
885	885	23.0	31	Raheem Sterling had had a stellar campaign, Kane showed flashes of his world-class ability and the central defensive pair of John Stones and Maguire were solid.
886	886	24.0	31	This will offer no comfort in the hours following such a devastating loss, but England can at least move forward with optimism.
887	887	25.0	31	Italy worthy winners Italy have won their sixth major tournament title (four World Cup, two Euros); among European nations, only Germany (seven) have won more As Italy's players and staff celebrated in front of their exultant fans, manager Roberto Mancini was left to reflect on an outstanding job, their 34th game unbeaten crowned with the Euro 2020 title.
888	888	26.0	31	Mancini has put together an impressive mix of youth and experience, and at the back he can still rely on those two old warhorses of Juventus and Italy, Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini, as durable as ever despite a combined age of 70.
889	889	27.0	31	Italy proved their pedigree with wins over Belgium and Spain in the knockout stage and were unfazed by having to face a thunderous Wembley packed with England fans.
890	890	28.0	31	And all done after failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, which was regarded as a national sporting humiliation.
891	891	29.0	31	Now Italy are back as the winners of Euro 2020, testimony to the work of Mancini and his players.
892	892	30.0	31	the stats Italy have won their second European Championship title, and first in 53 years (also 1968); it's the longest ever gap between championships in the tournament by a single nation, surpassing Spain's 44-year wait from 1964 to 2008.
893	893	31.0	31	England have won just 22% (two of nine) of their major tournament shootouts (World Cup/Euros), the lowest ratio of any European nation to have been involved in three or more.
894	894	32.0	31	Italy found themselves trailing in a game for the first time at Euro 2020, while overall they spent 65 minutes behind against England in the final, 21 more than they had been behind in their 33-game unbeaten run (in all competitions) coming into the final (44).
895	895	33.0	31	England posted their lowest possession in a game at Wembley (34.4%) since November 2016 v Spain (34.3%).
896	896	34.0	31	Gareth Southgate has made at least one change to the England starting XI for 37 consecutive matches, making a total of 200 changes in that time and last staying with the same starting line-up in the 2018 World Cup semi-final.
897	897	35.0	31	At one minute 57 seconds, Luke Shaw's opener (his first ever goal for England) was the quickest goal scored in the final of the European Championship, while it was also England's quickest in the competition overall and the earliest Italy have ever conceded in the competition.
898	898	36.0	31	At 34 years and 71 days, Italy's Leonardo Bonucci became the oldest player ever to score in a European Championship final, and second-oldest for a European side in any major tournament final (World Cup/Euros), after Nils Liedholm for Sweden v Brazil at the 1958 World Cup (35 years, 264 days).
899	899	37.0	31	Against Italy, Harry Kane failed to muster a shot or create a goal-scoring chance for only the second time in his 61 appearances for England, also doing so in a friendly against Switzerland in September 2018.

910	910	1.0	32	Italy won the European Championship for the first time since 1968 as goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma saved two England penalties en route to a 3-2 shoot-out win.
911	911	2.0	32	Both sides had fought out a 1-1 extra-time draw at a raucous Wembley on Sunday.
912	912	3.0	32	The giant keeper saved from Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka after Marcus Rashford hit the post, as Federico Bernardeschi, Leonardo Bonucci and Domenico Berardi all scored for the Italians.
913	913	4.0	32	Luke Shaw had given England a dream start with a superb goal after two minutes
914	914	5.0	32	but Italy, who offered almost nothing in response in the first half, gradually took command as the hosts sat back and leveled through Bonucci after 67 minutes.
915	915	6.0	32	It was the first final to be decided on penalties since Czechoslovakia beat West Germany in 1976 and will be wildly celebrated in Italy after they lost in the final in 2000 and 2012.
916	916	7.0	32	They made most of the running after halftime and in extra time and England can have few complaints after their early promise faded away.
917	917	8.0	32	It was nevertheless heartbreaking for most of the 67,000 Wembley crowd as England came up short in their first major final since they won the World Cup 55 years ago.
918	918	9.0	32	It had all started so well when Harry Kane spread the ball wide to Kieran Trippier
919	919	10.0	32	Gareth Southgate-™s faith in recalling him by sending over a curling deep cross that the fast-arriving Shaw met on the half volley to hammer inside the post for his first international goal.
920	920	11.0	32	™s Luke Shaw celebrates scoring their first goal [Frank Augstein/Reuters]
921	921	12.0	32	England had taken an early lead in their 2018 World Cup semi-final against Croatia before eventually being outplayed and beaten in extra time, but they did not look like giving up the initiative on home soil, playing on the front foot, though failing to threaten Donnarumma.
922	922	13.0	32	England keeper Jordan Pickford was similarly untroubled as Federico Chiesa-
923	923	14.0	32	™s blocked effort were all Italy had to show for a disjointed half.
924	924	15.0	32	Pickford was called into action after 57 minutes, blocking a Lorenzo Insigne shot and then getting down to palm away from Chiesa as Italy began to apply pressure, pinning England back.
925	925	16.0	32	It paid dividends when Bonucci pounced from close range after Pickford had turned Andrea Belotti-
926	926	17.0	32	It was a similar story in the first additional 15 minutes, though England did briefly force their way back into the game in the second period, albeit without either side creating anything to reward the crowd for their waves of noise.
927	927	18.0	32	So it went to penalties, where England-™s young guns failed and Italy took the glory.
928	928	1.0	33	Italy's prime minister announced Monday evening that he was expanding restrictions on travel to cover the entire country in an unprecedented peacetime move to try to stop the spread of coronavirus.
929	929	2.0	33	Giuseppe Conte said that a new government decree will require all Italians to meet a limited set of criteria -- such as a need to work or health conditions -- in order to travel outside the areas where they live.
930	930	3.0	33	He said the quarantine ordered by Rome in the north over the weekend was not enough and would have to be extended to the whole country, impacting the country's 60 million residents.
931	931	4.0	33	"There won't be just a red zone,"" Conte told reporters."
932	932	5.0	33	Italy registered 1,807 more confirmed cases as of Monday evening, for a national total of 9,172, the most cases of the virus outside of China.
933	933	6.0	33	The number of dead in Italy also increased by 97 to 463.
934	934	7.0	33	Early Sunday, Conte signed a decree attempting to lock down 16 million people in Italy's prosperous north -- including the entire Lombardy region and 14 provinces in the Piemonte, Veneto and Emilia Romagna regions -- until April 3.
935	935	8.0	33	Schools in Italy's center and south that were closed because of the virus were originally slated to re-open March 16.
936	936	9.0	33	Conte also criticized young people who have continued to gather to drink and have a good time amid a public health crisis.
937	937	10.0	33	Under the previous decree, pubs, bars and restaurants in the affected area were ordered to close at dusk.
938	938	11.0	33	"This nightlife ... we can't allow this anymore,"" he said."
939	939	12.0	33	The measures have caused confusion among Italians about who could travel where.
940	940	13.0	33	Authorities said Monday that six inmates in an Italian lockup died after they broke into the infirmary and overdosed on methadone.
941	941	14.0	33	The inmates were protesting virus containment measures inside the prison.
942	942	15.0	33	Authorities said inmates climbed onto the roof of the San Vittore prison in Milan and held up a painted sheet reading “Indulto,” Italian for pardon.
943	943	16.0	33	Measures to contain the spread of the virus have effectively ground the court system to a halt, increasing tensions among prisoners.
944	944	17.0	33	Italian doctors celebrated one small victory after the first patient diagnosed with the illness, a 38-year-old Unilever worker, was moved out of intensive care and began breathing on his own.
945	945	18.0	33	But the virus' rapid spread was forcing them to operate like war-time medics, triaging patients to decide who would receive access to scarce ICU beds.
946	946	19.0	33	Unfortunately we’re only at the beginning,” said Dr. Massimo Galli, head of infectious disease at Milan’s Sacco hospital.
947	947	20.0	33	"Travelers at Milan’s main train station had to sign police forms self-certifying that they are traveling for ""proven work needs,’’ situations of necessity, health reasons or to return home."
948	948	21.0	33	They also needed to provide identity documents, contact numbers and an exact reason for travel from the financial hub.
949	949	22.0	33	Across Italy, museums and archaeological sites were closed, weddings were canceled and restaurants were told to keep patrons more than 3 feet apart.
950	950	23.0	33	Officials ordered ski lifts across the country to close, even those outside the quarantine zone, after students whose classes were canceled began organizing trips to winter resorts.
951	951	24.0	33	Pope Francis celebrated Mass alone at the Vatican hotel where he lives, live-streaming the event, but he did resume some meetings.
952	952	25.0	33	For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.
953	953	26.0	33	For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.
954	954	1.0	34	Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte says travel restrictions and other strict public health measures will be imposed nationwide starting Tuesday to try to stop the spread of the new coronavirus.
955	955	2.0	34	Conte said Monday night that a new government decree will require people throughout the country of 60 million to demonstrate a need to work, health conditions or other limited reasons to travel outside the areas where they live.
956	956	3.0	34	The restrictions will take effect Tuesday and, as in northern Italy, will last until April 3, he said.
957	957	4.0	34	Conte told reporters, referring to the quarantine order he signed over the weekend that applied to a vast swath of northern Italy, with a population of 16 million.
958	958	5.0	34	Schools in the center and south of Italy that were closed because of the virus had been slated to reopen on March 16.
959	959	6.0	34	Italy registered 1,807 more confirmed cases as of Monday evening, for a national total of 9,172.
960	960	7.0	34	With those numbers, Italy again overtook South Korea as the country with the most cases outside China.
961	961	8.0	34	The number of people with the virus who died increased to 463.
962	962	9.0	34	The premier also took to task the young people in much of Italy who have been gathering at night to drink and have a good time during the public health emergency that started on Feb. 21.
963	963	10.0	34	This nightlife ... we can’t allow this anymore,” Conte said.
964	964	11.0	34	Under the weekend decree that applied to regions in the north, pubs, restaurants and cafes are required to close at dusk.
965	965	12.0	34	On Saturday night, alarmed at rumors over a quarantine in the north, many Italians fled the targeted regions in the northern red zone.
966	966	1.0	35	Payments on mortgages are to be suspended in Italy due to the coronavirus outbreak, the country’s government has announced.
967	967	2.0	35	More than 9,000 people have been infected by Covid-19 in Italy, where the total number of reported deaths jumped to 463 on Monday –
968	968	3.0	35	When asked about the possibility of halting mortgage payments on Radio Anch’io, Laura Castelli, the deputy economy minister, said: ”Yes, that will be the case, for individuals and households.
969	969	4.0	35	The entire country was placed on lockdown on Tuesday morning, with all public gatherings cancelled, and universities and schools closed until next month.
970	970	5.0	35	Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, said that everyone in Italy would be confined to the area where they live unless they are able to demonstrate a need to work, health conditions, or other limited reasons in order to travel elsewhere.
971	971	6.0	35	The lockdown already in place for northern parts of the country, encompassing about 16 million people, has now been extended to the whole nation.
972	972	7.0	35	Bars, restaurants and cafes across Italy are also to close at dusk as the government works to limit the spread of
973	973	8.0	35	Chaos broke out at prisons nationwide on Monday as inmates protested anti-coronavirus measures, which included restrictions on normal family visits.
974	974	9.0	35	Multiple prisoners died of what could be drug-related causes after people raided the pharmacy in Modena jail during the riot, officials said.
975	975	10.0	35	Italy has been the worst-hit country in Europe by coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
976	976	11.0	35	British Airways said on Tuesday that it had stopped all flights to the country after the lockdown measures were announced.
977	977	12.0	35	As of Tuesday, 52 per cent of deaths linked to Covid-19 outside China have happened in the southern European country.

979	979	1.0	36	Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree early Sunday, placing travel restrictions on the entire Lombardy region and 14 other provinces.
980	980	2.0	36	Locations affected by the lockdown include the financial hub Milan and the tourist destination of Venice and are subject to strict measures, including the closure of schools and universities and the cancellations of all public events, sports events and civil and religious ceremonies.
981	981	3.0	36	A woman walks in the almost deserted Central Station in Milan on Sunday after the lockdown was imposed overnight.
982	982	4.0	36	But questions remain as to how it will be enforced as trains and planes continued to go to and from Milan as scheduled on Sunday.
983	983	5.0	36	"There will be an obligation to avoid any movement of people,"" Conte said Sunday as he announced the new measures."
984	984	6.0	36	And even within the areas, moving around will occur only for essential work or health reasons.
985	985	7.0	36	"He added, ""We understand that these measures will impose sacrifices, sometimes small and sometimes very big."
986	986	8.0	36	But this is a time where we must take responsibility.
987	987	9.0	36	We need to understand that all of us need to adhere to the measures.
988	988	10.0	36	Restrictions have also been imposed throughout the rest of Italy, including the suspension of events at cinemas, theaters, museums and sports arenas.
989	989	11.0	36	The sweeping move came after the country saw a dramatic spike of 1,247 confirmed cases on Saturday, the Civil Protection Department said in a statement.

993	993	15.0	36	As of Sunday evening, Italy has recorded 7,375 cases and 366 deaths, the most fatalities outside mainland China.

996	996	18.0	36	"He began his address saying that it was quite unusual for the Pope to be ""locked away."
997	997	19.0	36	"We do this so that the close concentration of people won't spread the virus,"" he said via video, before praying for those suffering from the virus and those who are assisting them."

1003	1003	25.0	36	During a video call with Friar Marcello Longhi and CNN in Milan, Grandi said the lockdown could lead to more babies being conceived as couples stay at home.
1004	1004	26.0	36	As the lockdown began, many Italians were confused about what it would entail or whether they could return home.

1011	1011	33.0	36	The hotel she works at is closed, she said, and she said she has no idea when it will be able to reopen.
1012	1012	1.0	37	Ryanair is sharply cutting back on the number of flights it operates to and from northern Italy after the government’s lockdown of provinces in response to the coronavirus.
1013	1013	2.0	37	The airline’s announcement came after British Airways and easyJet cancelled more flights to northern Italy and offered refunds or rebooking after the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to regions operating coronavirus quarantine restrictions.
1014	1014	3.0	37	Ryanair will operate a maximum of one service a day, from Fridays to Mondays, on its routes from the region.
1015	1015	4.0	37	It will also suspend all Italian domestic flights to and from Bergamo, Malpensa, Parma and Treviso airports, which are located in the lockdown area.
1016	1016	5.0	37	Flights are able to continue and foreign nationals in Italy are free to depart despite the decree from Italian authorities banning the population of Lombardy and other provinces from leaving the region.
1017	1017	6.0	37	However, a number of EU countries, including Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Malta and Romania are restricting flights from northern Italy.

1026	1026	15.0	37	Air France-KLM extended a similar guarantee on Monday, allowing customers booking anywhere on its network in March to postpone flights at no extra cost until the end of May. Passengers wanting to postpone for longer or to change their destination or cancel will be offered a non-refundable voucher for future travel.
1027	1027	16.0	37	While some countries have banned airlines from flying in from Italy, the UK government is unlikely to introduce any such measure and has indicated it is a matter for airlines as private businesses.

1039	1039	1.0	39	The data posted online suggest that levels of antibodies that can target the Delta variant grow fivefold in people 18 to 55 who get a third dose of the vaccine.
1040	1040	2.0	39	Among people ages 65 to 85, the Pfizer data suggest that antibody levels that should protect against Delta grow 11-fold more than following a second dose.
1041	1041	3.0	39	The data, which involved tests of 23 people, have not yet been peer-reviewed or published.
1042	1042	4.0	39	It's not clear if boosted antibody levels actually correlate to better protection, or if that extra protection is even needed.
1043	1043	5.0	39	The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current vaccines protect people well against all the common variants.
1044	1044	6.0	39	"During a company earnings call on Wednesday morning, Dr. Mikael Dolsten, who leads worldwide research, development and medical for Pfizer, called the new data on a third dose of vaccine ""encouraging."
1045	1045	7.0	39	"Receiving a third dose more than six months after vaccination, when protection may be beginning to wane, was estimated to potentially boost the neutralizing antibody titers in participants in this study to up to 100 times higher post-dose three compared to pre-dose three,"" Dolsten said in prepared remarks ."
1046	1046	8.0	39	These preliminary data are very encouraging as Delta continues to spread.
1047	1047	9.0	39	The data also show that antibody levels are much higher against the original coronavirus variant and the Beta variant, first identified in South Africa, after a third dose.
1048	1048	10.0	39	Separately, Pfizer and its partner BioNtech released new safety and efficacy data for their coronavirus vaccine Wednesday, and said it shows protection holds up for at least six months, although it may start to wane slightly towards the end of that time.
1049	1049	11.0	39	The pre-print paper, posted Wednesday to the online server medrxiv.org, updates results from Pfizer's trial involving 44,000 volunteers around the world.
1050	1050	12.0	39	It found the overall efficacy was about 91% during the six months.
1051	1051	13.0	39	Vaccine efficacy against severe Covid-19 was about 97%, the data show.
1052	1052	14.0	39	The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed nor published in a journal.
1053	1053	15.0	39	The data show that the vaccine's efficacy peaked at more than 96% from a week to around two months after receiving a second dose of vaccine, and then appeared to gradually decline to 83.7% four to six months later, with an average decline of about 6% over the last two months.
1054	1054	16.0	39	Earlier this month, Pfizer announced it has seen waning immunity from its coronavirus vaccine, saying it is picking up its efforts to develop a third dose that will protect people from variants.
1055	1055	17.0	39	The company also specified it would seek emergency use authorization under the US Food and Drug Administration for a third dose in August.
1056	1056	18.0	39	But in an unusual move, the FDA and CDC said at the time Americans don't need third doses quite yet and that it was not up to companies alone to decide when an additional dose might be needed.
1057	1057	19.0	39	"US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy repeated that point Wednesday morning, telling CNN's Poppy Harlow, ""People do not need to go out and get a booster shot."
1058	1058	20.0	39	Also, there is much more to the immune system than antibodies.
1059	1059	21.0	39	For instance, experts say it remains unclear how antibody levels correlate with real-world immunity, and to what extent other parts of the immune system -- such as B cells and T cells -- could factor into protection.
1060	1060	22.0	39	soon Pfizer said it anticipates submitting data on a third dose of its coronavirus vaccine to the FDA as soon as next month, Dolsten said during Wednesday's earnings call.
1061	1061	23.0	39	"We are in ongoing discussions with regulatory agencies regarding a potential third-dose booster of the current vaccine and, assuming positive results, anticipate an emergency use authorization submission as early as August,"" Dolsten said."
1062	1062	24.0	39	In order for third doses to be administered to people in the United States, the emergency use authorization that the FDA issued for the vaccine would either need to be amended or, if the vaccine were fully FDA approved, a third dose could be given off label.
1063	1063	25.0	39	"We continue to believe it is likely that a third-dose booster may be needed within six to 12 months after full vaccination to maintain the highest level of protection, and studies are underway to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a third dose,"" Dolsten said, adding that data suggest antibody levels appear to decline around eight months after receiving a second dose of vaccine."
1064	1064	26.0	39	"Pending regulatory approval, we also plan to start an immunogenicity and safety study in August to evaluate an updated version of our vaccine specifically designed to target the Delta variant,"" Dolsten said."
1065	1065	27.0	39	"He mentioned how the Delta variant is the ""most transmissible"" yet seen and now represents about 83% of sequenced Covid-19 cases in the United States."
1066	1066	28.0	39	Surgeon general: 'People do not need to go out and get a booster shot'
1067	1067	29.0	39	At this point, the decision on if and when booster shots are necessary will be made by agencies such as the FDA and CDC, Murthy said on CNN on Wednesday.
1068	1068	30.0	39	"This data from Pfizer, we've been in talks with them about what they're seeing with regard to their studies related to boosters,"" Murthy said, when asked about Pfizer's new data."
1069	1069	31.0	39	But at this point, I want to be very clear: People do not need to go out and get a booster shot.
1070	1070	32.0	39	"Murthy said government agencies would be ""looking at the whole breadth of data that will come from companies, that will come from cohorts that the CDC is now following, where they're tracking whether or not there is any waning in immunity or increase in breakthrough rates."
1071	1071	33.0	39	Ultimately, that collective information is what will drive any decision about boosters.

1073	1073	35.0	39	"Murthy also said that the question of whether it was ethical for a third booster shot to be recommended while there is a major vaccine supply shortage in the developing world was a ""critical question"" because the ability to reduce the likelihood of future variants depends on tamping down spread of the virus around the world."
1074	1074	36.0	39	"We as a country have a vested interest in getting the rest of the world vaccinated,"" Murthy said."
1075	1075	37.0	39	It's one of the reasons why we don't want to have to choose between giving our population boosters, if it's required, and vaccinating the rest of the world.
1076	1076	38.0	39	This is why the United States is making sure it is increasing manufacturing capacity in other countries, he said, working with vaccine companies such as Pfizer and Moderna to ensure they are producing more for the rest of the world and donating excess supply to other countries.
1077	1077	1.0	40	Pfizer anticipates applying for emergency use authorization for a third dose of its vaccine as soon as next month.
1078	1078	2.0	40	"WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- American biopharmaceutical company Pfizer said Wednesday a third dose of its COVID-19 vaccine can ""strongly"" boost protection against the Delta variant."
1079	1079	3.0	40	Antibody levels against the Delta variant in people aged 18 to 55 who receive a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are greater than five-fold than following a second dose, according to data posted at the company's teleconference.
1080	1080	4.0	40	Among people aged 65 to 85, the Pfizer data suggest that antibody levels against the Delta variant after receiving a third dose are greater than 11-fold than following a second dose.
1081	1081	5.0	40	Pfizer anticipates applying for emergency use authorization for a third dose of its vaccine as soon as next month, Mikael Dolsten, who leads worldwide research, development and medical for Pfizer, was quoted by CNN as saying at the teleconference. ?
1082	1082	1.0	41	The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine waned over six months, but experts say the data still don't point to an immediate need for booster shots.
1083	1083	2.0	41	The study, which hasn't yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal, found that the vaccine was 97 percent effective at preventing severe disease from Covid-19 for at least six months — but the effectiveness against any symptomatic illness fell from 96 percent to 84 percent in the same period, falling by about 6 percent every two months.
1084	1084	3.0	41	"""I was generally encouraged by the results of the paper,"" said the lead study author, Dr. Stephen Thomas, a coordinating investigator for the Pfizer vaccine trial and director of the SUNY Upstate Institute for Global Health & Translational Science in New York."
1085	1085	4.0	41	He said the expectation was always that the vaccine's protection was going to wane.
1086	1086	5.0	41	The big question, he said, was whether it would wane to a degree that would affect the so-called public health burden of the disease, specifically hospitalizations and deaths.
1087	1087	6.0	41	"Even though we saw that at six months there was a waning of protection, there was a maintenance of protection against those severe outcomes that really make up the public health burden of the disease,"" Thomas said."
1088	1088	7.0	41	Overall, the study found that the vaccine was 91 percent effective at preventing any symptoms of Covid-19, from mild to severe, over six months.
1089	1089	8.0	41	Pfizer announced that finding in a news release in April.
1090	1090	9.0	41	"Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said he was ""positively surprised"" that the effectiveness was as high as it was for preventing symptoms."
1091	1091	10.0	41	"This data is all really encouraging and exactly what you'd expect,"" he said."
1092	1092	11.0	41	"You're never going to be able to protect as well against asymptomatic infection or mildly symptomatic infection, and that's OK,"" he said."
1093	1093	12.0	41	You just want to keep people out of the hospital and keep them from dying.
1094	1094	13.0	41	The new research looked at follow-up data gathered through March 13 on the more than 44,000 people who participated in Pfizer's Phase 3 clinical trial last year.
1095	1095	14.0	41	Because the study looked at data only through mid-March, it remains unclear how the shots fare against the delta variant, which became the most common strain of the virus in the U.S. early this month.
1096	1096	15.0	41	Experts continue to consider whether booster shots will be necessary.
1097	1097	16.0	41	Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has long said a booster would be needed in the coming months, although federal health officials say there's not yet evidence to say it's warranted.
1098	1098	17.0	41	In an earnings call Wednesday morning, Pfizer said a third dose increased levels of antibodies specific to the delta variant fivefold in people ages 18 to 55 and elevenfold in those 65 to 85.
1099	1099	18.0	41	Although the findings suggest better protection against the variant, more research is needed to determine whether that translates to better protection against illness.
1100	1100	19.0	41	Offit stressed that because the vaccine remains very effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalizations, it's too early to definitively say booster shots will be required.
1101	1101	20.0	41	"If the numbers climb to 5, 10 or 20 percent of people who are fully vaccinated and are still hospitalized or killed, then you can start thinking about a booster, but we're not there yet,"" he said."

1103	1103	22.0	41	Dr. Bob Wachter, chairman of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, agreed that the new data don't suggest it's time to rush out and get booster shots yet.
1104	1104	23.0	41	"This just shows that someone who has got their shots seven or eight months ago is at a little bit higher risk"" for a breakthrough infection ""than we thought, and it's a perfectly good justification for even vaccinated people to go back to wearing masks indoors,"" Wachter said, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision Tuesday to recommend that vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas with high levels of community spread."
1105	1105	24.0	41	But the dominance of the delta variant, combined with waning effectiveness of the vaccine over time, suggests that boosters will be needed at some point, he said.
1106	1106	25.0	41	"I don't think it's grounds for panic, and I don't think it's grounds to run out and find a booster today, because the overall protection against getting super sick and dying remains extraordinarily high,"" Wachter said."
1107	1107	26.0	41	But I do think it is one piece of the puzzle that says to all of us boosters are going to be in our future.
1108	1108	27.0	41	"I think [the study] says that there is a possibility that we may need booster doses if the protective efficacy of the vaccine continues to decline over time,"" Thomas said."
1109	1109	1.0	42	If third shots are cleared for the general population, the boosters would likely represent a multi-billion-dollar business for Pfizer.
1110	1110	2.0	42	In a study posted online but not yet peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal, Pfizer and BioNTech scientists reported that the vaccine had a sky-high efficacy rate of about 96 percent against symptomatic Covid-19 for the first two months following the second dose.
1111	1111	3.0	42	But the figure declined by about 6 percent every two months after that, falling to 83.7 percent after about four to six months.
1112	1112	4.0	42	Against severe disease, however, the vaccine’s efficacy held steady at about 97 percent.
1113	1113	5.0	42	— I wouldn’t say it’s waning,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University.
1114	1114	6.0	42	She did not see in the new study any evidence that boosters should go into use for the general population.
1115	1115	7.0	42	These data don’t support a need for that right now,” she said.
1116	1116	8.0	42	The findings fit with what scientists have learned about how the immune system fends off viruses.
1117	1117	9.0	42	Antibodies are the only defense to prevent an infection, but their levels typically drop in the months after vaccination or recovery from the disease.
1118	1118	10.0	42	If the coronavirus takes hold, immune cells can swoop in to destroy infected cells and make new antibodies.
1119	1119	11.0	42	That enduring defense produced by the vaccine may explain how the virus can sometimes breed in the nose — producing a cold or sore throat — but fail to reach the lung where it can cause serious disease.
1120	1120	1.0	43	The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a new report Monday summarizing the latest authoritative scientific information about global warming.
1121	1121	2.0	43	The report says almost all of the warming that has occurred since pre-industrial times was caused by the release of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.
1122	1122	3.0	43	Much of that is the result of humans burning fossil fuels — coal, oil, wood and natural gas.
1123	1123	4.0	43	Scientists say that only a fraction of the temperature rise recorded since the 19th century can have come from natural forces.
1124	1124	5.0	43	Almost all countries have signed up to the 2015 Paris climate accord that aims to limit global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit
1125	1125	6.0	43	— and ideally no more than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius)
1126	1126	7.0	43	by the year 2100, compared with the late 19th century.
1127	1127	8.0	43	200-plus authors looked at five scenarios, all of which will see the world cross the 2.7-degree threshold in the 2030s — sooner than in previous predictions.
1128	1128	9.0	43	Three of those scenarios will also see temperatures rise 3.6 degrees above the pre-industrial average.
1129	1129	10.0	43	The 3,000-plus-page report concludes that ice melt and sea-level rise are already accelerating.
1130	1130	11.0	43	Wild weather events — from storms to heat waves — are also expected to worsen and become more frequent.
1131	1131	12.0	43	the greenhouse gases humans have already released into the atmosphere, some changes will be “irreversible” for centuries even if emissions are drastically cut, the report said.
1132	1132	13.0	43	While many of the report’s predictions paint a grim picture of humans’ impact on the planet and its looming consequences, the IPCC also found that so-called tipping points, such as catastrophic ice-sheet collapses and the abrupt slowdown of ocean currents, are “low likelihood,” though they cannot be ruled out.
1133	1133	14.0	43	Big catch Meeting the most ambitious goal of the Paris accord — keeping
1134	1134	15.0	43	temperature increases to 2.7 degrees by the end of the century —
1135	1135	16.0	43	will only be possible through what are known as “negative emissions.
1136	1136	17.0	43	That means sucking more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than is added, something the report suggests could be done after 2050.
1137	1137	18.0	43	The panel doesn’t explain how this can be done, though, and many scientists are skeptical that it’s possible.
1138	1138	1.0	44	Irreversible changes, warmer temperatures sooner: 5 alarming findings from the UN climate change report Show Caption Hide Caption New climate change report from the IPCC issues 'code red for humanity' The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change releases a new and devastating report on the danger climate change has on the world.
1139	1139	2.0	44	A grim global report on climate change released Monday paints a dire picture for the future of Earth.
1140	1140	3.0	44	Climate change has led to irreversible shifts for the next hundreds to thousands of years, according to the report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
1141	1141	4.0	44	The effects of more extreme weather are felt across the globe, the report said, and average global temperature increases that could have devastating effects may come sooner than expected.
1142	1142	5.0	44	"Dubbed a ""code red for humanity"" by the United Nations, the report says unequivocally humans have caused climate change, driven up greenhouse gas emissions and led to warmer weather. '"
1143	1143	6.0	44	: UN report gives stark warning on climate change, says wild weather events will worsen Here are five of the most alarming findings in the climate report: We may reach 1.5°C of warming much sooner than previously expected
1144	1144	7.0	44	"""One of the most striking takeaways is that we may reach 1.5°C of warming a decade earlier than the IPCC had previously found,"" said Helen Mountford of the World Resources Institute."
1145	1145	8.0	44	Centigrade would increase heat waves, lengthen warm seasons and shorten cold seasons.
1146	1146	9.0	44	If temperatures were 2 degrees warmer, heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health, the report says.
1147	1147	10.0	44	In five scenarios of expected levels of greenhouse gas emissions laid out in the report, global warming of at least 1.5 degrees is the best estimate for the increase in temperature in the near term, from 2021 to 2040.
1148	1148	11.0	44	"Even under the lowest emissions scenarios, the report says a 1.5-degree warming in the next 20 years is ""more likely than not"" before bouncing back."
1149	1149	12.0	44	Previous predictions did not expect this level of warming this soon.
1150	1150	13.0	44	The five scenarios varied more in how much global temperatures will increase in the coming century, but even under a very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario, the range of temperature increase by 2100 is very likely to be 1 to 1.8 degrees
1151	1151	14.0	44	Human-caused climate change is already affecting 'every region across the globe' No region of the globe has been spared from the impacts of climate change, the report says.
1152	1152	15.0	44	"Climate change is ""affecting many weather and climate extremes,"" such as heat, heavy precipitation and drought."
1153	1153	16.0	44	Since the IPCC's last assessment, the evidence of humans' influence on specific weather events has strengthened.
1154	1154	17.0	44	The report says extreme heat has become more frequent and more intense across most parts of the world since 1950.
1155	1155	18.0	44	"The IPCC asserts with ""high confidence"" that human-caused climate change is the main driver and that without human influence, some of the extreme highs would be ""extremely unlikely."
1156	1156	19.0	44	Heavy precipitation has increased in frequency and intensity across most regions, the report said.
1157	1157	20.0	44	The report found the share of hurricanes that reach the devastating levels of Category 3 to 5 storms has probably increased over the past 40 years.
1158	1158	21.0	44	Humans have increased the chances of extreme compound weather events, such as the frequency of concurrent droughts, fire weather and flooding.
1159	1159	22.0	44	The report found a direct relation between increasing temperatures and extreme weather events.
1160	1160	23.0	44	"the average global temperature is, expect ""clearly discernible increases"" in extreme heat waves, heavy precipitation and droughts."
1161	1161	24.0	44	For example, hot temperature extremes that typically occurred only once every 10 years without human-caused climate change are likely to occur 4.1 times if temperatures increase by 1.5 degrees Centigrade.
1162	1162	25.0	44	If temperatures increase by 2 degrees, a once-in-every-10-years extreme is likely to occur 5.6 times.
1163	1163	26.0	44	Under a 4-degree warming scenario, the extreme heat occurs 9.4 times.
1164	1164	27.0	44	Each incremental increase in global temperature would lead to lower levels of Arctic sea ice, snow cover and permafrost.
1165	1165	28.0	44	Under all five emission scenarios the report lays out, the Arctic is likely to see at least one September month that is practically free of sea ice before 2050.
1166	1166	29.0	44	Many changes to Earth are irreversible for centuries and millennia
1167	1167	30.0	44	In a number of areas, greenhouse gas emissions have caused irreversible damage, and the effects will be felt on the time scale of centuries to millennia, according to the report.
1168	1168	31.0	44	The report says ocean temperature changes and ocean acidification, mountain and polar glacier melt and sea level rise are all expected to continue over the next hundreds of years regardless of human intervention.
1169	1169	32.0	44	Over the next 2,000 years, even if global temperatures are kept to a 1.5-degree increase, the average global sea level is expected to rise 2 to 3 meters.
1170	1170	33.0	44	The report says ice loss in Greenland over the 21st century is virtually certain and there is high confidence that ice loss will increase cumulative emissions.
1171	1171	34.0	44	As emissions and temperatures increase, Earth's water cycle becomes more intense Earth's natural cycles are expected to be acutely effected by rising global temperatures and greenhouse gas emissions, the report says.
1172	1172	35.0	44	As the climate warms, Earth's water cycle will increasingly tend to more extremes.
1173	1173	36.0	44	Increased variability in rainfall tied to El Niño is very likely under three of the global emission scenarios.
1174	1174	37.0	44	The way Earth naturally combats increased carbon emissions is likely to be affected in the coming decades, the report says.
1175	1175	38.0	44	Earth's carbon sinks – generally its forests and oceans – will store an increasing amount of carbon under scenarios with higher emissions, but they will be less effective in the higher emission scenarios, the report says.
1176	1176	39.0	44	As a result, higher levels of emissions will remain in the atmosphere.
1177	1177	1.0	45	"Climate change is changing Earth in ways that are ""unprecedented"" in thousands of years — and in some cases, hundreds of thousands of years — according to a blistering report released Monday by the United Nations."
1178	1178	2.0	45	"The sobering assessment also found that some changes that are already playing out, such as warming oceans and rising sea levels, are ""irreversible for centuries to millennia."
1179	1179	3.0	45	"U.N. Secretary General António Guterres called the findings a ""code red for humanity,"" adding that the ""alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable."
1180	1180	4.0	45	"The report is the most comprehensive assessment from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 2013 and provides the strongest case yet for human-caused global warming, saying it's ""unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land."
1181	1181	5.0	45	The report also found that climate change is intensifying, occurring at an accelerated pace and is already affecting every region of the planet.
1182	1182	6.0	45	"It has been clear for decades that the Earth's climate is changing, and the role of human influence on the climate system is undisputed,"" Valérie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the IPCC's Working Group I, said in a statement."
1183	1183	7.0	45	Ko Barrett, the IPCC’s vice- chair and a senior climate adviser at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told NBC News that the report shows that no matter what humans do going forward, the future will be hotter than it is now.
1184	1184	8.0	45	"It can be kind of demoralizing or depressing to think that there are so many things that are kind of irreversible for a long period of time,"" Barrett said."
1185	1185	9.0	45	But the good news is that, that these irreversible changes can be slowed down with rapid, strong and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
1186	1186	10.0	45	The IPCC, established in the late 1980s, consists of thousands of scientists across 195 member governments who pore over the most recent published and peer-reviewed research on global warming and compile the findings into a report on the current state of the climate.
1187	1187	11.0	45	The assessment, which includes a look at the future risks and impacts of climate change, typically represents consensus within the scientific community.
1188	1188	12.0	45	The assessment comes less than three months before world leaders are set to convene from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland, for the 2021 U.N. Climate Change Conference.
1189	1189	13.0	45	Countries are expected to set forth ambitious targets to reduce emissions by 2030, and the IPCC's findings will likely feature prominently in the discussions.
1190	1190	14.0	45	John Kerry, former secretary of state and the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, said in a statement that the report should compel leaders to take aggressive action to put the planet on a path toward net zero emissions by midcentury.
1191	1191	15.0	45	"All major economies must commit to aggressive climate action during this critical decade,"" he said."
1192	1192	16.0	45	We can get to the low carbon economy we urgently need, but time is not on our side.
1193	1193	17.0	45	The report states that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have caused global warming at a rate not seen in at least the past 2,000 years.
1194	1194	18.0	45	It's estimated that human-caused climate change is responsible for approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming since 1850-1900, the earliest period with reliable measurements of global surface temperatures, the authors wrote.
1195	1195	19.0	45	"What's more, the report found that global temperatures are expected to exceed 2 degrees Celsius of warming this century ""unless deep reductions in [carbon dioxide] and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades."""
1196	1196	20.0	45	"The report makes it very clear: If we want to limit warming to any level that is sort of manageable, you have to just cut back the emissions very deeply and immediately,"" said Corinne Le Quéré, a professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia in the U.K., who was not involved with the IPCC assessment."
1197	1197	21.0	45	Climate scientists have warned that the increase in average global temperatures should be limited to under 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees
1198	1198	22.0	45	Fahrenheit, in order to avoid the most devastating effects of global warming.
1199	1199	23.0	45	The 2-degree benchmark was set by climate negotiators in Copenhagen in 2009, but studies have increasingly found that the target may already be out of reach.
1200	1200	24.0	45	Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics In a news briefing Monday, Inger Andersen, under-secretary-general of the United Nations and executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said the IPCC has been warning of the dangers of climate change for more than three decades, but that countries — especially the world's biggest economies that are responsible for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions — haven't done enough to address the problems.
1201	1201	25.0	45	The new IPCC assessment goes further than any of the group's previous reports in linking human-caused climate change with increases in extreme weather events around the world.
1202	1202	26.0	45	"It is virtually certain that hot extremes (including heat waves) have become more frequent and more intense across most land regions since the 1950s, while cold extremes (including cold waves) have become less frequent and less severe,"" the authors wrote, adding that human-caused global warming is the ""main driver"" of those changes."
1203	1203	27.0	45	Recent events, including widespread drought in the western U.S., heat waves across Europe and North America and devastating wildfires in Greece, Turkey and the U.S., have highlighted the consequences of a warming world.
1204	1204	28.0	45	"The climate is behaving like an athlete on steroids,"" said Erich Fischer, a climate scientist at ETH Zürich and one of the authors of the IPCC assessment."
1205	1205	29.0	45	The report also details how the increasing ocean and surface temperatures will cause myriad physical changes in climate — including drought, heat waves, heavy rainfall and coastal flooding — in different regions of the planet.
1206	1206	30.0	45	The assessment is part of the IPCC's latest summary on climate change, called the Sixth Assessment Report or AR6, that will be published next year.
1207	1207	31.0	45	The full report consists of four sections: the Working Group I report on the science of climate change; the Working Group II report on the vulnerabilities and socioeconomic impacts; the Working Group III report on possible ways to mitigate climate change; and the Synthesis Report, which reviews the findings from all the working groups and integrates relevant information for policymakers.
1208	1208	1.0	46	A growing number of world leaders, including President Biden, have endorsed the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, though current policies in the major polluting countries are still far off-track from achieving that target.
1209	1209	2.0	46	The 10 biggest emitters of greenhouse gases are China, the United States, the European Union, India, Russia, Japan, Brazil, Indonesia, Iran and Canada.
1210	1210	3.0	46	The new report leaves no doubt that humans are responsible for global warming, concluding that essentially all of the rise in global average temperatures since the 19th century has been driven by nations burning fossil fuels, clearing forests and loading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane that trap heat.
1211	1211	4.0	46	The changes in climate to date have little parallel in human history, the report said.
1212	1212	5.0	46	The last decade is quite likely the hottest the planet has been in 125,000 years.
1213	1213	6.0	46	The world’s glaciers are melting and receding at a rate “unprecedented in at least the last 2,000 years.
1214	1214	7.0	46	Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide have not been this high in at least 2 million years.
1215	1215	8.0	46	Ocean levels have risen 8 inches on average over the past century, and the rate of increase has doubled since 2006.
1216	1216	9.0	46	Heat waves have become significantly hotter since 1950 and last longer in much of the world.
1217	1217	10.0	46	Wildfire weather has worsened across large swaths of the globe.
1218	1218	11.0	46	Bursts of extreme heat in the ocean — which can kill fish, seabirds and coral reefs — have doubled in frequency since the 1980s.
1219	1219	1.0	47	Lawmakers and top climate officials in President Joe Biden's administration sounded the alarm on Monday in response to a new report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, urging nations to swiftly limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
1220	1220	2.0	47	"If Senators truly followed the science in this report, we'd have 100 votes for climate action to match the 100 percent certainty that human-caused climate change is destroying our planet,"" Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts said in a statement."
1221	1221	3.0	47	This report must be the final warning to the world that time has run out to save the planet from dangerous and irreversible climate change.
1222	1222	4.0	47	The latest IPCC report finds the world is rapidly running out of time to keep human-caused global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
1223	1223	5.0	47	The report lays out different scenarios if world nations decarbonize and collectively limit their warming to 1.5 degrees, compared to what will happen if they don't take action -- leading to global warming of 2 or 3 degrees Celsius.
1224	1224	6.0	47	The latter would have catastrophic consequences for the planet, leading to already severe weather events like fires and flooding getting worse.
1225	1225	7.0	47	"Every bit of warming matters, and every bit of avoided warming matters,"" Dr. Jane Lubchenco, the deputy director for climate and environment at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told CNN."
1226	1226	8.0	47	We have to enhance ambition and tackle the climate crisis like the existential threat that it is.
1227	1227	9.0	47	With global warming currently at 1.1 degrees Celsius, this summer has already set new records for heat and drought in parts of the United States.
1228	1228	10.0	47	Some lawmakers said they feared this summer could be tip of the iceberg.
1229	1229	11.0	47	"It's not as if this year we're experiencing is going to be a blip, it's going to be the best-case scenario if we don't make changes,"" Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota told CNN."

1232	1232	14.0	47	"We cannot afford to squander this once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver historic investments in clean energy, good-paying jobs, and environmental justice,"" said Rep. Kathy Castor, who chairs the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis."
1233	1233	15.0	47	Top Senate Democrats released new details Monday on the climate provisions in their upcoming 3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill, which would included a new Clean Electricity Payment Program, clean energy, manufacturing, and transportation tax incentives and grants, funding for a Civilian Climate Corps, new polluter fees on methane and carbon imports, and consumer rebates for home electrification and weatherization, among other things.
1234	1234	16.0	47	"By finally tackling climate change, we can spare our country and our planet the most devastating effects of global warming,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York wrote in a Dear Colleague letter."
1235	1235	17.0	47	Many lawmakers believe that passing a robust reconciliation bill is their best hope to achieve President Biden's goal of slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent relative to 2005 levels by 2030.
1236	1236	18.0	47	Biden has also said he wants to get the United States to net-zero emissions by 2050, and decarbonize the US electricity sector by 2035.
1237	1237	19.0	47	"This is really a double wake-up call,"" said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology."
1238	1238	20.0	47	I think finally we're beginning to accept we've got to do something.
1239	1239	21.0	47	"The Biden administration on Monday also announced 5 billion in funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency aimed at helping states and localities prepare for ""extreme weather and climate-related disasters."
1240	1240	22.0	47	That funding will go toward grants for communities to reduce vulnerability to natural hazard events, additional grants for hazard mitigation, and funding for flood mitigation grants, according to a news release.
1241	1241	23.0	47	"The world must come together before the ability to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is out of reach,"" said US Climate Envoy John Kerry in response to the IPCC report."
1242	1242	24.0	47	"We can get to the low carbon economy we urgently need, but time is not on our side."""
1243	1243	25.0	47	The bulk of budget reconciliation will likely happen in September and October, teeing up the crucial United Nations Climate Change Conference where the US and other nations will meet to discuss decarbonization commitments.
1244	1244	26.0	47	As Biden's top international climate official, Kerry will have a crucial role to play in the coming international talks in Glasgow, Scotland later this fall.
1245	1245	27.0	47	"In a statement, Kerry said Glasgow ""must be a turning point in this crisis"" where all major economies commit to ""aggressive"" action on climate during the next decade."
1246	1246	28.0	47	"We cannot delay ambitious climate action any longer,"" Blinken said in a statement."
1247	1247	29.0	47	This moment requires world leaders, the private sector, and individuals to act together with urgency and do everything it takes to protect our planet and our future in this decade and beyond.
1248	1248	1.0	48	UN chief says the prediction of quicker onset of global warming tipping point ‘must sound a death knell’ for fossil fuels.
1249	1249	2.0	48	A UN climate report that predicts quicker global warming than anticipated just three years ago “must sound a death knell” for coal, oil and gas and is “code red” for humanity, according to the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
1250	1250	3.0	48	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded on Monday that drastic cuts to emissions are needed in order to hold the global temperature to under the 1.5C (2.7F) limits set by the 2015 Paris Agreement.
1251	1251	4.0	48	Today’s IPCC Working Group 1 Report is a ‘code red’ for humanity,” Guterres said.
1252	1252	5.0	48	The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable: Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk.
1253	1253	6.0	48	Global heating is affecting every region on Earth, with many of the changes becoming irreversible.
1254	1254	7.0	48	This report must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels before they destroy our planet.
1255	1255	8.0	48	Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said the long-awaited report contained “no real surprises”.
1256	1256	9.0	48	It confirms what we already know from thousands of previous studies and reports –
1257	1257	10.0	48	It’s a solid summary of the current best available science.
1258	1258	11.0	48	It confirms what we already know from thousands previous studies and reports – that we are in an emergency.
1259	1259	12.0	48	It’s a solid (but cautious) summary of the current best available science.
1260	1260	13.0	48	It doesn’t tell us what to do,” she noted of the report, which synthesises reams of climate studies conducted in recent years.
1261	1261	14.0	48	We can still avoid the worst consequences, but not if we continue like today, and not without treating the crisis like a crisis.
1262	1262	15.0	48	British PM Boris Johnson said the report should serve as “a wake-up call” for world leaders as they prepare to gather in Scotland later this year for the next summit on the climate crisis.
1263	1263	16.0	48	Today’s report makes for sobering reading, and it is clear that the next decade is going to be pivotal to securing the future of our planet,” Johnson said in a statement.
1264	1264	17.0	48	We know what must be done to limit global warming – consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the front line.
1265	1265	18.0	48	World leaders will meet at the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November, in what is being described as the most important meeting on the crisis since the 2015 Paris summit.
1266	1266	19.0	48	As the IPCC makes plain, the impacts of the climate crisis, from extreme heat to wildfires to intense rainfall and flooding, will only continue to intensify unless we choose another course for ourselves and generations to come,” said US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.
1267	1267	20.0	48	All major economies must commit to aggressive climate action during this critical decade.
1268	1268	21.0	48	Humanity can no longer delay “ambitious” climate action, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday after the release of the UN report.
1269	1269	22.0	48	This moment requires world leaders, the private sector, and individuals to act together with urgency and do everything it takes to protect our planet,” Blinken said in a statement.
1270	1270	23.0	48	We cannot delay ambitious climate action any longer,” he added.
1271	1271	24.0	48	French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the report “rightly emphasises, once again, the real urgency to take all the necessary measures to fully implement the Paris accord (on climate change), which is the compass for all of us”.
1272	1272	25.0	48	French Environment Minister Barbara Pompili said in a statement that “the challenge is immense because it involves emerging within a decade from a civilisation that has been based on fossil fuels for several centuries”.
